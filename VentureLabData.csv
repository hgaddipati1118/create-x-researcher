These novel carbon nanotube (CNT)-based textured PV cells permit greater energy absorption‚Äîa significant advantage over traditional PV cells that offers multiple benefits for both terrestrial and space-based applications. Developed at Georgia Tech, these 3D PVs can be scaled to form large, periodic arrays of vertically aligned CNTs. Common thin-film PV materials (e.g., cadmium telluride [CdTe], copper zinc tin sulfide [CZTS], or perovskite) are deposited on the upper side of each array. These innovative materials act as a 3D scaffolding of sorts‚Äîa structure that provides a light-trapping effect that produces more power at off-normal angles without requiring additional sun-tracking machinery.

Specifically, the 3D geometry enables multiple photon impingements and therefore an increased number of interactions between a photon and a photoabsorber. The result is a greater likelihood of absorption and a resulting increase in photocurrent and power output as compared with similar planar cells.

For space-based applications in particular, the increased power output should yield an increased energy output as the sun subtends all zenith/beta angles. Such arrays are being tested for efficacy on the International Space Station as part of the Materials International Space Station Experiment (MISSE)-11, MISSE-12, and NanoRacks External Platform (NREP)-1 missions.

3357,Bio-SIM-S1: An Automated Biological Sample Aliquoting Processing System,"Reducing time, costs, and manual steps needed for processing swab samples
Bio-SIM-S1 is a non-contact, automated biological sample aliquoting processing system designed to address the often time-consuming and costly steps involved with processing biological samples. Georgia Tech‚Äôs patented innovation is particularly well suited to addressing the needs of labs tasked with processing large-scale quantities of cotton-tipped swabs, Dacron applicators, or sponges used for collecting buccal cells and other biological samples for DNA profiling, virus/infectious disease testing, and more.

The system leverages a robotic instrument that reads and records the sample identification number, cuts the swab or applicator containing the biological sample, and places a portion of the sample into a specific location in a designated tube or multi-well plate. Bio-SIM-S1 ensures sample integrity while automating the process of sample cutting and aliquoting, thereby eliminating a manual step of such lab processes. In doing so, it greatly reduces the analyst or technician hours required to process biological samples compared with manual protocols. It also reduces the time and cost of biological processing lab operations.

Georgia Tech inventors have found a method that uses nanoparticles of noble metals for molecular imaging, diagnoses, and treatment. Near infrared light is used as a cancer treatment because of its ability for maximum penetration through tissue and to chemically kill malignant cells. The researchers have found a method in which noble metal nanoparticles that have scattering in the near infrared wavelengths can be conjugated to antibodies for use in molecular imaging and diagnoses. This method can be used to differentiate cancer cells from normal cells or to identify the presence of a target substance. They can be differentiated or identified in either living or dead cell cultures (microscope) or in vivo (endoscope) by observing the scattering properties or absorption wavelengths. This involves administering nanoparticles that are conjugated to a specific binding molecule, such as an antibody, to both healthy and malignant cells, and subsequently illuminating them using electromagnetic radiation to compare differences in scattering/absorption patterns between malignant cells and healthy cells. This method provides an improved, alternative approach for molecular imaging and cancer diagnoses and treatment that is easily prepared, non-toxic, and has excellent detecting properties for cellular imaging.

3662,Cell-Free Biomaterial for Tissue Regeneration and Repair,"A method for using differentiating embryonic stem cells to efficiently derive acellularized biomaterial with potent regenerative abilities for use in tissue engineering and wound healing
Georgia Tech inventors have developed acellularized tissues from clusters of ES cells that include growth and differentiation factors sufficient to promote wound healing in adjacent tissue. The materials retain native structural and biochemical elements but are devoid of cell nuclei and cytoskeleton, replicating the unique signals of early embryonic patterning. As a result, the biomaterial could facilitate regeneration of tissues and organs‚Äîbe they defective, diseased, damaged, or ischemic‚Äîand direct tissue morphogenesis in vivo. Because it is based on embryoid bodies, this technique offers the regenerative potential provided by signals derived directly from ES cells during the course of induced cellular differentiation.

Inventors at Georgia Tech have developed a replaceable heart valve prosthesis that eliminates the need to select between quality of life and durability of valve. The anchoring conduit has a harbor allowing for a releasable connect to the heart valve prosthesis. Then, a temporary valve is delivered in a condensed state. The temporary valve, once the anchor disables the natural heart valve and creates a cavity, replaces the function of the original valve. After the temporary valve is in place, a more long-term valve, biological or mechanical, can be implemented. The procedure, when compared to current methods, is minimally invasive, and allows for easy replacement once prosthesis begin to wear.

Samples or molecules can be placed on the membrane which is electrostatically actuated by using a top electrode buried in the membrane and patterned bottom electrodes fabricated on the detection surface. In addition, membranes can be built as an array and combined with other force sensors, such as cantilever based or FIRAT based sensors, for parallel force spectroscopy and fast imaging applications.","

3949,Low Temperature Extraction of Hydrogen From Biomass,"A method of using sawdust as a renewable source of hydrocarbons for hydrogen production
Georgia Tech inventors have developed a method of using sawdust as a renewable source of hydrocarbons for hydrogen production. Through an aqueous-phase reforming (APR) of the biomass, the polymeric lignocellulosic components of the biomass are broken down and the formation of hydrogen is achieved at temperatures much lower (230 ¬∞C) than those currently used in gasification and pyrolysis processes. Increasing acid concentration hastens the breakdown of these components. Addition of a reforming catalyst, such as platinum aluminum oxide (Pt/Al2O3), facilitates the formation of more hydrogen in the reaction product gas.

Comparisons between APR of various feeds (biomass, glucose, ethylene glycol, and wastepaper) showed effectively no difference in the amount of hydrogen produced per gram of feed. However, the hydrogen yields per gram of carbohydrate were different, with biomass giving the highest yield. Hydrogen yields may be further increased through the use of a continuous flow process over batch processing.

3968,Vortex Generators for Prosthetic Heart Valves,"An array of vortex generators that gain passive flow control that minimizes the shear stresses experienced by blood elements flowing across bileaflet mechanical heart valves. 
Inventors at Georgia Tech have designed an array of vortex generators to gain passive flow control that minimizes the shear stresses experienced by blood elements flowing across bileaflet mechanical heart valves (BMHV). The array of vortex generators are placed on the leaflets to counteract the formation of strong vortices leading the transitory leakage jet, thus reducing the overall platelet activation for the valve and blood damage. The vortex generators induce the formation of secondary counter-rotating stream wise vortex pairs which interact with the shear layer, resulting in a reduction of cross stream mixing. This cross stream mixing leads to broadening of the jet stream, and to the dissipation of small-scale motions.

There are two types of vortex generator arrays: (1) rectangular fins and (2) hemispherical fins. The arrays are fabricated using molding bio-compatible polymeric materials, such as PDMS. The elasticity and other mechanical properties of the fin‚Äôs molding material minimizes the fin‚Äôs cross stream protrusion when the flow over the leaflets reverses its direction. Additionally, the angle of attack, height, depth, and spacing of the vortex generators are great enough to retard boundary layer formation, thereby reducing the sheer stress. The vortex generators have been mounted on a 25mm BMHV and showed a reduction of thrombin anti thrombin (TAT) by greater than 42% during testing.

4087,Polarization-Based Method for Mitigating Wireless Signal Interference Both During Transmission and Receipt ,"Improves mitigation performance relative to full-band processing for co-channel interference
This invention is a method for mitigating interference from wireless transmitted or received signals using polarization-based architectures. For a wireless signal that contains both a desired signal and an interference signal, researchers at Georgia Tech have successfully developed an approach to separate the interference signal from the desired signal by breaking the received signal into sub-bands and filtering each sub-band with a frequency-dependent polarization filter designed to suppress the corresponding interference component. This polarization-based method can be used to achieve frequency-dependent interference suppression with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based systems as well as systems employing other communications formats, such as code division multiple access (CDMA).

For OFDM, which is popular for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, the method involves receiving OFDM signals via a dual-polarized antenna and forming channel estimates for the desired and interference signal components on each subcarrier of the received OFDM signal. It then computes minimum mean square error (MMSE) weights to maximize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Using the polarization mode dispersion found in a typical wireless channel, this sub-band processing approach improves mitigation performance relative to full-band processing, which employs a single polarization filter across all frequency components. Instead, by optimizing the SINR as a function of the frequency component, this invention provides more effective polarization filtering solutions.

4096,Segmenting Stroke-Like Structures in Images,"A method for segmenting tubular or stroke-like structures in images

Georgia Tech inventors have created a method for segmenting tubular or stroke-like structures in images. Embodiments of the present invention are directed to segmenting stroke-like structures in images using pearling. Pearling is the generation of an ordered series of pearls, which are variable-radius 2D disks, as a discrete representation of the stroke geometry. Pearling is robust to fluctuations in image intensities (due to noise, etc.) as the forces acting on a pearl are integrated over the region inside the pearl. Pearling is computationally efficient and well suited to user interactivity. Such interactivity can allow operator guidance of the segmentation in a particular direction, as well as operator correction of errant segmentation results.

4182,Advancing Mass Spectrometry with Novel Interface,"Unique device improves size-selective collection and desolvation of charged droplets to enhance the sensitivity of mass spectrometry 
Georgia Tech‚Äôs¬†Dry Ion Localization and Locomotion (DRILL) device is designed to improve¬†sensitivity and detection capability in mass spectrometry (MS) through the manipulation of electrosprayed droplet trajectories. DRILL uses inertial sorting via a swirling flow to prescribe different fates for electrosprayed droplets based on their size, allowing a greater degree of control than previously available. More specifically, DRILL is an improved interface between an electrospray ionization (ESI) source and MS inlet that significantly improves the signal-to-noise ratio, sensitivity, and limit of detection by reducing the amount of analyte ions lost due to incomplete desolvation.

The DRILL interface ensures that (1) a greater fraction of charged droplets produced by the ion source is transferred to completely desolvated ions, (2) most of charged analyte molecules enter the MS inlet, (3) sample dispersion is minimal, and (4) entry of neutral solvent molecules into the MS inlet is minimized. With these advancements, this novel Georgia Tech device enables a new level of optimization for all applications of mass spectrometry techniques.

These tissue-selective histone deacetylases inhibitors (HDACi) suppress the growth of transformed/cancerous cells and display tissue-targeted anticancer activities.¬†These compounds contain macrolide moieties, which accumulate in resident macrophage-enriched organs, including the lungs, liver, and spleen, and in tumors‚Äîparticularly breast tumors.¬†

In mice experiments, representative compounds inhibited the growth of primary mammary tumors and protected the lung tissues from tumor infiltration.¬†The compound accumulated within the tumor nodules in the liver and the lungs at levels that are 50 to 90 folds higher than in healthy lungs and liver. This demonstrates the possibility of successful delivery of treatment to tumor nodules, potentially rendering these compounds more effective than currently available HDACi agents.

Additionally, Georgia Tech researchers identified other cohorts of HDACi that target liver tissue as a new class of anti-hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) agents. Tests showed that this class of macrolide-based HDACi, which are selective for sub-class I HDACs, preferentially accumulated in the liver tissue and robustly suppressed tumor growths in an orthotopic model of HCC. The liver tissue-selective accumulation property of these compounds may give them a unique advantage over most current HDACi. Thus, these compounds have the potential to positively impact HCC therapy.

This invention includes a vibration sensor and a substrate. A first electrical contact and a spaced apart second electrical contact are both disposed on a first surface of the substrate. The elongated piezoelectric nano-scale structure extends outwardly from the first surface of the substrate and is disposed between, and in electrical communication with, the first electrical contact and the second electrical contact. The elongated piezoelectric nano-scale structure is oriented so that a voltage potential exists between the first electrical contact and the second electrical contact when the elongated piezoelectric nano-scale structure is bent from a first state to a second state.

4231,New Methods of Fabrication for Biosensor Arrays,"Methods to manufacture a sensor or sensor array system based on electrochemical detection
Researchers at Georgia Tech have developed methods to manufacture a sensor or sensor array system based on electrochemical detection. The system contains an array of microelectrodes created on a CMOS chip (complementary metal oxide semiconductor). On the surface, each microelectrode contains a capture biomolecule, which is linked to a polymeric layer through a multivalent metal complex or a covalent bond. The capture biomolecule is one half of a recognition binding pair; the other half is the target analyte to be detected, which is generally also a biomolecule.

Georgia Tech inventors have developed a thermally and mechanically stable polymer electrolyte membrane for use in fuel cells.

Membranes may contain single or multiple layers that are laminated before use in a fuel cell.

A key feature is a skin layer that is molecular-level grafted phosphonic acid polysiloxane, while the central layer consists of free acid doped with heterocycle grafted polysiloxane. This design inhibits free acid leakage from the central layer due to repulsion of the same-charge carrier in the central and skin layers. The PEMs may be synthesized by sol-gel process, spraying methods, or similar methods.

Georgia Tech inventors have fabricated poly(N-isopropylmethacrylamide) nanoparticles having a core-shell structure or topology and a hydrogel network structure. The fabricated particles provide a general platform for the delivery of materials to cells. The nanogel core particles are synthesized by free-radical precipitation polymerization. Following synthesis, the nanogel core particles are used as seeds for the addition of a shell hydrogel. The nanoparticle platform technology enables the incorporation of various materials including proteins, antibodies, small molecules, peptides, and oligonucleotides. The researchers have demonstrated the use of the nanoparticles in peptide targeting. The nanoparticles are designed to escape from endosomes following endosomal uptake without requiring additional triggering mechanisms. In addition, the materials can be added to the hydrogel network via simple swelling methods without the addition of any covalent attachment chemistries because the hydrogel provides for a multitude of non-covalent interactions. Furthermore, the payloads can escape from the nanoparticles following cellular uptake without the addition of triggering mechanisms.

4483,Method for Minimally Invasive Heart Valve Procedures,"A method to perform heart valve repair using a minimally invasive system
Inventors at Georgia Tech have designed a method to perform heart valve repair using a minimally invasive system. The design is broken down into four main categories: (1) an external shape adjustment system, (2) an annuloplasty delivery system, (3) a suturing and anchoring system, and (4) a temporary adjustable annuloplasty system. The external shape adjustment system applies pressure to reduce the size of the valve annulus, while the delivery system is used to position an annuloplasty implant. The delivery device is made of a unitary tube connected to a deployment head that is operated by an apparatus controller and guided using biomedical imaging technology. The deployment head is manufactured with suture hooks which are able to detach from the deployment head and connect the annuloplasty implant to the heart. A temporary adjustment system allows for the implant to be adjusted to the desired shape and size for the valve to function. This new system provides a less invasive approach to heart-valve repair and eliminates the need for cardiopulmonary bypass.

The transmitter utilizes an analog-to-time conversion (ATC), while the receiver utilizes a time-to-digital conversion (TDC) to reduce the size and power consumption of the implantable unit by moving the digitization circuitry to an external unit. As a result, the overall system noise is reduced, a wider bandwidth is used, and both the complexity and power dissipation on the transmitter unit has lowered.

Georgia Tech researchers have developed a delivery system for growth factors to the human body that improves growth factor retention and allows for tissue regeneration within an enclosed space. The technology has been used for the repair of a small animal bone segmental defect. While much bone regeneration research is focused on the use of three-dimensional scaffolds that support loading in vivo, these scaffolds usually do not provide an optimal environment for cellular function and suffer from slow resorption kinetics. However, recently we have shown that electrospun nanofiber meshes possess a number of features that improve cell attachment, morphology, and function and promote tissue regeneration. When a growth factor is delivered within a tubular nanofiber construct to a critically-sized segmental bone defect, uniform accelerated bone regeneration was observed compared to controls and other scaffolds. Results have shown that compared to the clinical standard collagen sponge, the mesh/hydrogel system with the same dose of BMP-2 promoted significantly more bone in growth and higher mechanical strength at 12 weeks. Perhaps most importantly, the mesh/hydrogel system had biomechanical strength equivalent to age-matched intact (i.e. uninjured) femurs. Results from large animal studies are anticipated in 2012.

4712,Super Aggregation: Multihoming for Wireless Devices,"Improving performance of multiple wireless interfaces used simultaneously  
This wireless interface aggregation system addresses the need for performance improvements for mobile devices with multiple heterogeneous wireless connections, such as Wi-Fi¬Æ, Bluetooth¬Æ, and cellular networks. Referred to as super aggregation, Georgia Tech‚Äôs solution enables mobile device wireless interfaces to achieve better performance when used simultaneously than each would achieve on its own‚Äîin effect, an aggregate performance improvement greater than the sum of its parts. The solution specifically addresses transmission control protocol (TCP) acceleration, which aims to achieve better throughput on network connections without the need to modify end user applications.

Georgia Tech‚Äôs solution is made up of three super aggregation principles. First, the solution takes advantage of the fact that, even when each interface may have relatively small bandwidth, selectively offloading some portions of its transferred data can have a positive impact on wireless performance. In addition, the solution uses proxying to improve the overall performance of data transfer and to ensure that critical control information relating to transmission data on the first wireless interface can be transmitted by the second wireless interface. Finally, the solution employs intelligent mirroring of some portions of data being transferred on interfaces with comparatively lower bandwidth, thereby improving perceived performance.

4716,Periodic Arrays for Frequency-Based Beam Steering,"An effective way of directing energy in specified directions without the need for individual control of array components
Georgia Tech inventors have created an effective way of directing energy in specified directions without the need for individual control of array components (contrary to typical ultrasonic sources) through the use of periodic source arrays. Beam steering of energy propagated from an array is achieved by exploiting interference phenomena (i.e., constructive and/or destructive interference) generated by spatial periodicity of the array and the simultaneous activation of its components. Such interference phenomena produce waves with frequency dependent directional characteristics, which allow directional scanning to be performed simply through a frequency sweep. As such, the need for beam-forming algorithms and associated hardware may be avoided. In addition, spatially periodic piezoelectric actuators used in some embodiments can be exploited for tuning the excitation to a specific wave mode and, therefore, may be able to combine mode tuning with beam steering capabilities in a single device.

4878,Fine-Pitch Chip-to-Substrate Interconnect Assemblies for Advanced Electronics Applications,"Bonding mechanism to join copper bumps on flip-chips to substrates
This new technique for interconnected assemblies overcomes the limitations of solder bumps in electronic systems, enabling shorter interconnections, fine pitch, and higher input/output (I/O) density. An adhesive bonding mechanism replaces solder technology in chip-package interconnects to join flip-chip copper bumps to organic or inorganic substrate materials.

The copper bumps connect with the pads on the substrate so as to power the circuits on the die. Before assembly, the adhesive material is heated into a gel-like structure, which allows the copper bumps to pierce through it and connect with the substrate pads. Following assembly, the adhesive is reheated and cured to form a stable, rigid polymer that holds the assembly together.

Adhesive bonding is widely used with gold bumps and inorganic substrates, but Georgia Tech‚Äôs method is the first to demonstrate the reliability of using industry-standard copper bumps on both inorganic and organic substrates.

Secure: Forms a mechanical locking structure via the bump and substrate deformation

4897,Oxyfuel Combustor Arrangements to Reduce Emissions,"An arrangement to improve combustion systems using controlled gas flows
Georgia Tech researchers have developed a combustor system and method for an oxy-fuel type combustion reaction. The system includes a set of nested cylindrical shells and strategically placed carbon dioxide, oxygen, and fuel inlets. The shells form separate mixing zones for first mixing oxygen and carbon dioxide and then for introducing fuel into the system. A combustion zone is also included, and a series of openings in the inner shell can be used to divert carbon dioxide from the inlet away from the first mixing zone to mix with and cool the combustion product prior to reaching the turbine inlet nozzle. The oxygen to carbon dioxide ratio can also be varied to increase flame stability and to control the combustion product temperature. The system is also compatible with a high-pressure oxygen stream, which reduces costs and assists in regulating pressure drops and improving gas mixing.

4930,Method For Converting Solar and Waste Heat into Usable Energy,"An approach to harvesting solar and waste energy by exploiting and enhancing the inherent instabilities of stratified, thermally buoyant air layers in both open and closed spaces
Georgia Tech inventors have developed an approach to harvest solar and waste energy by exploiting and enhancing the inherent instabilities of stratified, thermally buoyant air layers in both open and closed spaces. These unstable heated layers can lead to intense vertical-column vortices, similar to tornados and dust devils although considerably less violent in strength. Inducing and ‚Äúanchoring‚Äù these vortices to a turbine sustains power continuously, as long as thermal stratification (buoyancy) of the air layer is maintained. It has been demonstrated that the momentum generated by these vortices can be harnessed to drive a vertical-axis turbine coupled with electric power generators. The technology provides a method for inducing and sustaining a vortex by arranging turbine blades around a central heating source that creates an initial thermal plume. As the heat rises through the boundary layer, the turbine blades impart sufficient angular momentum to drawn the air back through the vanes and impart power to the attached turbine generator.

Inventors at Georgia Tech have used a similar (remote) LIDAR technique to detect the presence of the nuclear materials by measuring the local concentration of N2 ionized molecules. A laser strobe (short pulses of specific wavelength) is aimed at the volume surrounding the potential radioactive source near the ground level, causing the excited/ionized nitrogen molecules to fluoresce. A receiver, (telescope co-located with the laser) subsequently collects the fluorescence photons, further converting it into an electrical signal by a photodetector. A narrowband optical filter reduces the background noise from solar and artificial illumination.

The intensity of the received signal is then translated into the concentration of excited/ionized N2, and, ultimately, into the measure of the nuclear material radiation/presence. The technology enables radioactive materials detection by measuring (escaping) ionized air by using either direct detection or standoff LIDAR.

5016,Wideband Data Transmission Using Pulse Harmonic Modulation,"A modulation technique, called Pulse Harmonic Modulation (PHM), enabling wideband, low power data transmission across inductive telemetry links that operate in the near-field domain
Maysam Ghovanloo and Farzad Inanlou from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech developed a modulation technique, called Pulse Harmonic Modulation (PHM), enabling wideband, low power data transmission across inductive telemetry links that operate in the near-field domain. By using sharp and narrow pulses, similar to impulse-radio ultra wideband (IR-UWB) in the far-field, significant reduction in the transmitter power consumption can be achieved.¬† This method helps to achieve a high data rate without reducing inductive link quality factor and selectivity while enhancing the ability to block interferers.

The received signal consists of an oscillation pattern that is modulated by the amplitude and timing of the pulses. These pulses facilitate data demodulation with low BER.

The PHM technique uses a pattern of sharp pulses with specific time delays and amplitudes that minimize the inter-symbol interference by amplitude modulating the received pulse harmonics. PHM does not require the coils to have characteristics such as low-Q (Quality Factor) and high SRF (self-resonance frequencies), which are not desired in the IMDs because they tend to lower the selectivity of the inductive link and signal-noise ratio at the receiver and impose size constraints due to large parasitic components.

Improves the bandwidth and robustness of short-range wireless inductive links formed across the skin to send the necessary data from external sensor to implanted micro-simulators

","The main application of the PHM is in neuroprostheses, such as invasive brain-computer interfaces or cochlear/retinal implants, which need to transfer large volumes of data across the skin. It may also be used in short range proximity-based digital communications with high throughput wireless devices. Other examples of near-field data transmission are radio-frequency identification (RFID), contactless smartcards, and high throughput wireless sensors.

Or imagine you lay your phone down on a table at Starbucks, the surface of which is a large display. Simply by laying your phone down, your video content gets mirrored onto that larger table display while your phone is also being charged.

Inventors at Georgia Tech have developed a method of applying a gate to graphene that does not require the use of a dielectric layer. Graphene is deposited on a non-conductive substrate such as silicon oxide or silicon carbide. A metal gate, composed of a metal with a high contact resistance with graphene, is placed on a portion of the graphene structure. Next, two electrical contacts are placed on either side of the graphene structure so that the metal gate is between the two contacts. The two metal contacts function as a source and a drain while the metal layer functions as a gate. In spite of the direct physical contact between the metal and the graphene, the contact resistance between the two is large enough that a significant potential difference can be maintained without causing undesirable large currents to flow between them.

5110,ZnO Nanowire Structures to Flexible Substrates ,"A fabrication process to grow horizontal, high aspect ratio ZnO nanowires on a ZnO substrate
Zhong Lin Wang, Sheng Xu, and Yue Shen from the School of Materials Science and Engineering at Georgia Tech have developed a fabrication process to grow horizontal, high aspect ratio ZnO nanowires on a ZnO substrate. They have also demonstrated transfer of the ZnO array to a flexible substrate. The nanowire array is grown on a single crystal ZnO substrate covered in polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) resist. An array of rectangular openings is etched using electron beam lithography (with a dose of 260-360 C/cm2). ZnO nanowires grow along the c-axis, so the long axis of these openings parallels the substrate‚Äôs c-axis. The substrate is floated on a nutrient solution of zinc nitrate hexahydrate and hexamethylenetetramine in a 1:1 ratio. at 80 to 85¬∞C for 2.5 hours. The horizontal nanowires emerge from the openings in the resist. Openings 400 nm wide and 5Œºm long produce horizontal nanowires 1Œºm wide and 13.2Œºm long. Each nanowire has a shared epitaxial relationship with the substrate and each other. Thus, when nanowires coalesce, they create monolithic single crystal structures such as long nanowires on the order of millimeters in length. After cooling to ambient, the ZnO array is cleaned using isopropyl alcohol to remove absorbed water. To remove the array of horizontal nanowires, a thin layer of PMMA prepolymer is spun on the array and allowed to polymerize to the resist. With the ZnO nanowires buried, the PMMA thin film is peeled from the substrate

Georgia Tech inventors are developing a new scatter correction scheme for X-ray CBCT based on the routinely used diagnostic multi-detector CT (MDCT) images in the radiation treatment planning, which has the potential of outperforming all competing scatter correction techniques. This technology demonstrates that the scatter signal can be obtained using the planning MDCT data due to its ‚Äòfree‚Äô prior information.

To realize the scatter removal scheme, the primary signals of the CBCT projects are simulated via forward projection on MDCT data. The subtraction between the simulated projections from the true CBCT projection provides the scatters signals plus the primary signal difference between the MDCT and the CBCT scans, which is mainly due to the patient geometry deformation. After an accurate patient setup, the deformation only leads to high frequency primary signal perturbations. Based on the dominant-low frequency behavior of scatter signals, accurate scatter estimations are finally achieved via smoothing techniques.

5187,Advance Mobility Improvement for Organic Field Effect Transistors ,"A method to increase dramatically‚Äîby more than 2 orders of magnitude‚Äîthe mobility of organic field effect transistors (OFETs)
Avishek Aiyar, David M. Collard, Rakesh Nambiar, and Elsa Reichmanis from the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Georgia Tech have developed a method to increase dramatically‚Äîby more than 2 orders of magnitude‚Äîthe mobility of organic field effect transistors (OFETs). Their operationally simple approach uses low-intensity ultrasound to aggregate solutions of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) within chloroform (CHCl3) or other common solvents. When these ultrasound-induced aggregates are deposited onto a substrate via spin-coating, the resulting polymer film exhibits significantly higher charge transport compared to other approaches. Specifically, irradiating a P3HT-containing CHCl3 solution with 40 kHz (130 W) of ultrasound for less than 5 minutes increases the film‚Äôs mobility to 2.6 x 10‚Äì2 cm2/(V‚Ä¢s) compared with a mere 4.2 x 10‚Äì4 cm2/(V‚Ä¢s). Achieving this 100-fold improvement in charge transport did not require any additional processing or special deposition techniques.

To address the limitations of conventional methods, inventors at Georgia Tech have developed a novel technology that will accomplish all transmission and receive tasks in a small area, with low power without compromising the performance. Since synthetic phased array beamforming is used, no phase/delay generation circuits on the CMUT array chip are needed. This technology innovatively ensures that the temperature of the catheter does not increase to damaging levels when the catheter is powered and allowed to dry. To date, other electronics have not considered this issue involving power limitations. In order to protect the imaging probe against overheating and to enable higher power consumption while imaging, there is a low power temperature switch.

5260,Improving the Perceived Quality of Images for 3D-TV,"An algorithm for disocclusion removal in depth-image rendering
Dr. Ghassan AlRegib from Georgia Tech has developed an algorithm for disocclusion removal in depth-image rendering for 3D-TV that allows for high quality rendering and low computational complexity without the need to alter the depth map image. Hierarchical Hole-Filling (HHF), a new DIBR-based technique, eliminates the need for pre-processing of the depth map in previous approaches. HHF uses a pyramid like approach to estimate the hole pixels from a sequence of lower resolution estimates of the 3D wrapped image. The lower resolution estimates involves a pseudo zero canceling plus Gaussian filtering of the wrapped image. Starting backwards, the lowest resolution hole-free image is expanded, via interpolation, and pixel values are used to fill in the holes in the higher resolution image. The procedure is repeated until the image with highest resolution is hole-free.

***This HHF algorithm is in the operational prototype stage with successful tests completed.

5430,Click Hydrogel for Re-Synostosis Therapy,"A hydrogel based on copper-free click chemistry, (CH:click hydrogel) that is composed of a cross linker and a multifunctional reversible addition‚Äìfragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) co-polymer
Inventors at Georgia Tech have developed a hydrogel based on copper-free click chemistry, (CH:click hydrogel) that is composed of a cross linker and a multifunctional reversible addition‚Äìfragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) co-polymer. The reaction forms a covalently cross-linked gel; proceeds rapidly and can be safely carried out in living tissue. The architecture of the co-polymer allows for the incorporation of controlled release moieties for the delivery of small molecules, proteins, and nucleic acid therapeutics. The CH hydrogel also allows for customized release rates and degradation characteristics. The ratios between the cross linker and the co-polymer can be altered to achieve specific mechanical and degradation properties of the polymer. A major advantage of this hydrogel is that the polymerization does not produce free radicals and can be accomplished in-vivo. Completed mouse studies prove the effectiveness, safety, and utility of this technology in treating craniosynostosis.

5433,Translating Sound into Soft Touch for Haptic Devices,"A technology that transforms inaudible sound waves into tactile pressure, providing an improved haptic feedback
A Georgia Tech inventor has developed an innovative method to provide tactile/haptic information to the user by transmitting inaudible sound waves through a sealed capsule (i.e., air pocket) made of a flexible polymer. Unlike current haptic technologies‚Äîvibromotors, magnetic coils with rigid armatures, rollers, and electro-active polymers‚Äîthis patented invention is easy to incorporate into textiles and other products. The innovative mechanism uses an electromechanical or piezoelectric speaker to issue inaudible sound waves of a recorded heartbeat or other sound file stored on a compact flash memory device. The low-frequency sound waves are then transmitted through small, flexible air pockets, causing tactile/haptic actuation within other objects, such as a textile or a touch screen device.This technology emerged from a technological art project that sought to engineer a textile that would pulse according to a recorded heartbeat signal.

5449,Quasi-Melt Processing Technique for Stronger Single-Polymer Composites,"Enables mass production using a wide variety of conventional melt processing methods
This processing technique strengthens single-polymer composites (SPCs) and makes it easier to mass produce them using conventional melt processing methods. SPCs are comprised of fibers and matrices that are made from the same polymer. When compared with heterogeneous composites, SPCs offer superior impact resistance, reduced weight, and enhanced recyclability while maintaining high mechanical strength.

However, production techniques for SPCs are challenging because the fiber and matrix material have similar melting temperatures. Work-around methods involving fiber hot compaction are time-consuming and expensive. Georgia Tech‚Äôs novel quasi-melt method involves use of a meso-state liquid that can maintain a fluidic state at a temperature well below the nominal melting temperature of the polymer. The quasi melt then combines with high-strength fibers to form an SPC with excellent mechanical properties.

5459,Eliminating Phase Separation Issues,"A technique to grow group-III nitride alloys
Georgia Tech researchers have developed an innovative technique to grow group-III nitride alloys, including AlN, InN, GaN, InGaN, and AlInGaN. Their method employs metal-rich molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) while successfully avoiding thermal and spinodal decomposition. It also maintains a metal adlayer thickness that reduces the probability of indium surface segregation. The¬† technique produces alloy growth at higher rates and at lower processing temperatures (~250‚Äì850 ¬∞C) than with other MBE processes. It achieves this by periodically modulating the metal flux while maintaining a constant nitrogen flux, a process that can be called metal-modulated epitaxy (MME). This technique minimizes metallic droplets forming on the surface while still taking advantage of enhanced adlayer mobility provided by excess metal. The lower growth temperatures enable the growth of four-element alloys. The method also can involve the use of a reflection of high-energy electron diffraction apparatus, providing an in situ analysis of metal adlayer thickness, surface smoothness, and growth rates.

5501,Using Smart Macros to Optimize User Actions on Smartphones,"Improves user experience in remote versions of desktop applications
This software optimization solution improves the user experience of using desktop applications on mobile phones. The generic architecture consists of a front-end client that sits at the mobile phone and a back-end server that runs in the target platform where the applications are installed, which can be a desktop computer, a cloud service, or the mobile phone. The building blocks of the system are smart macros that aggregate user actions required for tasks. They do not have the robustness issues of classical graphical macros nor depend on application support as do application macros. The design approach enables users to create custom smart macros on their desktop computer for any application and then invoke and execute them from their mobile phone, reducing the burden of executing tasks and providing a near-desktop level experience.

The system uses four design principles: application-agnostic robust macros, low-burden macro presentation, macro extensibility, and offline macro suggestion. The system further analyzes user behavior and suggests one or more macros based on a repetitive pattern of user behavior. While the system is specific to making desktop-based applications usable on a mobile phone, the design principles can be applied to native mobile applications as well. This Georgia Tech innovation significantly reduces user burden and bridges the gap of user experience between a desktop computer and a smartphone.

5589,Patterned Graphene Structures on Silicon Carbide,"
Walter Alexander de Heer from the School of Physics at Georgia Tech has discovered that graphene on the sidewalls of steps on the silicon-terminated face of SiC graphitizes (i.e., forms graphene layers) more readily than on the horizontal surface of silicon-terminated SiC. This growth differential can be exploited to produce narrow and well-annealed graphitic ribbons without complex lithographic steps.

An elongated trench is formed along a predetermined path on the face of the SiC crystal with the dimensions desired to produce a graphitic ribbon. The SiC crystal and trench are annealed to form a ribbon with a V-shaped cross section that forms along the path of the trench. The trench can be formed in a variety of shapes to produce specific ribbons. For example, a bifurcated trench will produce a bifurcated ribbon, and a crossed trench will result in a crossed ribbon. The edges of the ribbons formed with this method have clean edges and demonstrate ballistic charge-transport properties.

Anthony J. Calise, Kilsoo Kim, and Tansel Yucelen from the School of Aerospace Engineering at Georgia Tech have developed simple adaptive control system design that augments existing control systems. This less complex adaptive system can control both minimum phase and non-minimum phase systems, including difficult-to-control aircraft longitudinal dynamics.

The inventors have employed a parameter-dependent Riccati equation approach to adaptive control. This approach assumes that a state observer (i.e., sensor) is employed in the nominal controller design. The observer design is modified and used instead of a reference model. This is combined with a novel adaptive weight law that ensures that estimated states follow both the reference model states and the true states so that errors are bounded, resulting in a more stable system.

Calise, Kilsoo Kim, and Tansel Yucelen from the School of Aerospace Engineering at Georgia Tech have developed simple adaptive control system design that augments existing control systems. This less complex adaptive system can control both minimum phase and non-minimum phase systems, including difficult-to-control aircraft longitudinal dynamics.The inventors have employed a parameter-dependent Riccati equation approach to adaptive control. This approach assumes that a state observer (i.e., sensor) is employed in the nominal controller design. The observer design is modified and used instead of a reference model. This is combined with a novel adaptive weight law that ensures that estimated states follow both the reference model states and the true states so that errors are bounded, resulting in a more stable system.","

5680,Non-Destructive Quality Control of Automated Weld Processes,"A patented system for nondestructively measuring weld characteristics
This method for nondestructively measuring weld characteristics¬†generates narrowband ultrasounds and uses a signal processing procedure that combines wavenumber-frequency (k-w) domain filtering and synthetic phase tuning to reduce the complexity of Lamb-wave signals.

Laser generated ultrasound methods have previously been used to measure weld penetration depth in thick plates using time-of-flight diffraction techniques to determine weld quality. This method no longer works when the thickness of a structure decreases to the wavelength¬† of an ultrasound signal. In these thinner structures, determining weld penetration requires the ability to measure the diffraction of highly complex Lamb waves. These waves vary with material density and thickness, and robust computational systems are required to evaluate feedback signals.

This technology uses k-w domain filtering to remove unwanted wave components and synthetic phase tuning to amplify and isolate a particular Lamb-wave mode. The signal processing procedure facilitates the calculation of reflection coefficients of Lamb waves that result from the presence of weld joints. This results in an effective, nondestructive method of evaluating penetration depth of butt welds in thin plates.

Georgia Tech inventors have designed a microfluidic technology that generates chemical cues to a dense array of cells while simultaneously using image-based assays to observe cell response at a single-cell resolution. The design couples arbitrary chip design with a chemical signal generator using a perforated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane, which allows the delivery of finely-tuned dynamic chemical signals to individual cells. This microfluidic device ensures that all cells loaded in the platform experience the same chemical signal simultaneously- which shows that any differences observed between cells is due the heterogeneity of the cell population and not by experimental design. The chemical generator also has the ability to deliver high frequency chemical signals over a large temporal dynamic range in order to simulate different biological process over different time scales. In summary, this microfluidic technology enables fast and repeatable switching of stimulus and buffer at a single cell resolution that is necessary in understanding signal transduction pathways.

5818,"Using Hardware ""Fingerprints"" to Enhance Network Security","Addressing one of the most significant threats to the security of cyber infrastructure‚Äîthat is, insider attacks by users with valid username/password credentials
Abdul Raheem Beyah and Cherita Corbett from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech have developed an innovative intrusion detection system (IDS) with an entirely new approach to detecting evolving threats. Using hardware signatures that are innate in network traffic, the Georgia Tech system detects unauthorized devices that are inserted into the network.

This successful solution relies on the signature generated by the ‚Äúbehavior‚Äù of data packets‚Äîeven those that are encrypted‚Äîand leaked into normal network traffic by the hardware. This unique hardware signature (akin to a fingerprint) makes it possible to determine whether a node is authorized to access the network, regardless of whether it achieved that access using legitimate login credentials.

Georgia Tech‚Äôs network-based approach has significant advantages over the current industry approach of using network access control (NAC) solutions. A NAC solution requires a client on each node that it manages to identify the node and to control access to the network. However, many devices are not NAC enabled because of an unsupported operating system (e.g., Mac OS, UNIX, Linux), and thus a large number of seemingly benign devices such as phones, printers, thermostats, and cameras are unmanageable and cannot be secured. Georgia Tech‚Äôs innovation does not require a client and therefore will work for unmanageable devices (which will far outnumber manageable devices in the future).

Long-Term Solution: Because no software client is required, this technique can be used to identify both current and future unmanageable devices.
Failsafe: Because it relies on inherently unique signatures tied to hardware‚Äôs diverse compositions, component manufacturers, and physical differences, the system is difficult to defeat by unauthorized‚Äîor even authorized‚Äîusers.
Reduced Vulnerability: As a network-based solution, this method eliminates the security vulnerabilities associated with software additions at each node.
Less Complex: This approach functions with just a single system per network segment rather than multiple node-based systems.
Simple and Low-Cost Implementation: The system is inexpensive to deploy and leverages existing infrastructure investments.
","All major companies and governments in the United States and abroad use NAC systems for access control and device management. This new system can be used to extend those systems to supplement current techniques for identifying manageable devices (i.e., devices running software clients) and as a new method that identifies unmanageable devices.","Hardware,Software,Networks,Wireless,Defense and Security","Raheem A.

5886,Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting from Hydraulic Pressure Fluctuations,"A system that can generate power by converting hydrodynamic pressure ripples into low power electricity
Inventors at Georgia Tech have developed a system that can generate power by converting hydrodynamic pressure ripples into low power electricity. The invention is based on the concept of piezoelectric power generation and uses an array of screw-in piezoelectric stack inserts to assist with the extraction of the generated power. The proposed configuration enables the AC (alternating current) output across the electrodes to be converted into a stable DC (direct current) signal.

This signal can be regulated to obtain the desired voltage level required for an external electrical load or storage component. Since the voltage levels in piezoelectric energy harvesting are relatively high compared with other transduction methods, the higher voltage levels are stepped-down using a DC-DC converter in the energy generation mechanism proposed here. Additionally, the layers of the piezoelectric stack are combined in a circuit configuration that increases current flow while keeping the voltage at relatively low levels and simplifying the regulation process on the DC side of the mechanism.

Georgia Tech researchers have developed hybrid zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) materials that allow for the continuous tuning of their porosity and functionality. ZIF materials in general contain metal centers connected by imidazole linkers. The continuous control over pore characteristics (like size, shape, flexibility, and functional groups) of the hybrid ZIFs means that the materials can be tailored to a specific application, like for CO2/N2 or CO2/CH4 separations for natural gas purification.

6075,Wideband Data Transmission Using Pulse - Delay Modulation,"A modulation technique that uses very narrow pulses for wireless transmission of serial data bits through an inductive link
Maysam Ghovanloo and Mehdi Kiani from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech have developed a modulation technique that uses very narrow pulses for wireless transmission of serial data bits through an inductive link. Called Pulse-Delay Modulation (PDM), this new modulation method transmits data via a pattern of successive pulses. PDM facilitates higher data transmission rates in the presence of strong power carrier interference. This reduces power consumption on the transmitter and improves the signal-to-noise ratio of data communication.

This system includes a new wireless data link along with a conventional wireless power link. The wireless data link consists of three major components: transmitter (Tx), inductive link, and receiver (Rx). The Tx consists of a Pulse-Pattern Generator (PPG), which produces a pattern of one or two pulses for every data bit. The transmitted data pulses do not have any considerable effects on the power carrier in the power transmission path. The use of a separate inductive link for power transfer allows the power transfer efficiency to remain high while maintaining a high data transmission bandwidth.

Georgia Tech inventors have developed a transparent and flexible NG (TFNG) using a ZnO nanowire (NW) array on a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate. The fully packaged NG has¬† transparency, flexibility, and robustness. It is able to harvest energy under a rolling vehicle tire with stable output. Thus, it can be used as a self-powered dynamic sensor to detect vehicle speed and weight, which can be used to monitor transportation flow.

First, the transparent and flexible PDMS substrate is prepared in the ideal thickness. Closely packed ZnO NWs are uniformly grown on the PDMS to form the core component of the 1.5 cm ¬¥ 1 cm TFNG. The NWs are then coated with a polymer for insulation. Finally, transparent electrodes are deposited on the top and bottom surfaces. The transmittance of the PDMS film is over 80%, and that of the fully packaged device is 50‚Äì60% (with potential for significant improvement) in the visible range.

This technology provides a significantly more cost-effective method for dewatering fibrous sludge discarded from paper mills.

The process requires isolation of the soy protein from soy flour. By suspending the soy in alkali and then adding it directly to the sludge, the process separates the protein from the flour in situ. The CPAM, used to maintain filtrate clarity, is added afterward to avoid exposure to the alkali.

This combination results in an increase in cake solids during belt pressing of fiber or fibrous sludge. A slightly higher CPAM supplement can combat the higher filtrate total suspended solids (TSS) that may be experienced, reducing the cost savings accordingly.

The cost of the soy-CPAM combination is one-fifth that of CPAM used alone. Not only is the soy cheaper than the CPAM, but it also has less environmental impact than using 100% CPAM. ¬†In addition, the cost of soy is much more stable than the cost of CPAM, which fluctuates with the price of oil from which it is produced.¬†

Georgia Tech inventors have developed an innovative hybrid tooling system that enables an additive approach for continuously creating discrete or non-discrete patterned films. Based on a novel method of controlling flow, the technology systematically integrates computer-aided design (CAD), a complex algorithm, and the tool. First, the system receives an initial pattern from CAD and converts it into an automation command. Then, it digitizes and sends the command to the actuation system, which executes the command to create the pattern.¬†

The tooling itself is comprised of a slot die offset by a shim. The bottom surface of each die half is equipped with an array of pins that are actuated based on the automation commands.

The advantage of this hybrid tool is that it allows for a purely additive approach to making layer-based devices without the need for an additional subtractive step. With the integration of CAD into the system, the process allows for making complex patterns that cannot be realized by other technologies. This single-step process will also allow for significant cost savings over traditional methods, especially when processed at ambient conditions.

This technology is a nanostructured carbon with high surface area and high energy density designed for energy storage in supercapacitors and hybrid batteries as well as capacitive water desalination. It is synthesized via a low-cost, scalable process of creating atomic layer thick carbonaceous fragments that increase the surface area of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) materials.

This carbon can be fabricated into supercapacitor electrodes that provide as high as 200¬†F/g capacitance and 50‚Äì90¬†Wh/Kg energy density, significantly more than the current state of the art.

Georgia Tech researchers have developed a new active flow control (AFC) technology which exploits controlled aerodynamic flow-structure interactions to manipulate aerodynamic load distributions on flight and ground platforms.¬† In addition to enhancing aerodynamic maneuvers, such control can also alter the effective properties of the platform structure to mitigate or completely avoid the adverse effects of aero-elastic instabilities.¬† A key element of the technology is that the interactions between the aero-structures and the air flow over them and therefore the flow-effected aerodynamic loads, are regulated by distributed air bleed.¬† The bleed actuation is driven through the aerodynamic surfaces by inherent pressure differences owing to the air flow (e.g. across aircraft wings).¬† The system involves the incorporation of passages through the surface (i.e. pores), which are activated or deactivated in real-time using low-power, surface-integrated louver actuators.¬†

The investigations at Georgia Tech demonstrated that the interaction between controlled bleed and the cross flow over lifting surfaces can be tailored to alter its apparent aerodynamic shape and thus the aerodynamic loads over a broad range of wind conditions.¬† Because the bleed is driven by the air motion it is inherently low-power, robust, low-weight, and easily integrable, and obviates the need for complex mechanical or electromechanical control surfaces that suffer from significant limitations in terms of power, weight and complexity.

Younan Xia and Shuifen Xie from the School of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech have developed a method of synthesizing spatially controlled palladium (Pd)-rhodium (Rh) hetero-nanostructures with a core-frame structure and concave faces by confined overgrowth of Rh atoms at the corners and edges of Pd cubic seeds. This is achieved using a combination of kinetic control and blocking effect of bromide capping agent through a seed-mediated approach.

Three types of Pd polyhedrons (i.e., cuboctahedrons, octahedrons, and cubes) were applied as the seeds. Injecting Rh precursor solution slowly into a reaction solution containing the Pd polyhedral seeds and bromide capping agent with a syringe pump confines the generated Rh atoms to selectively deposit at the corner and edge sites of Pd cubic seeds or on the {111} surface of the Pd cuboctahedral and octahedral seeds. Using Pd seeds with different shapes, different Pd-Rh hetero-nanostructures with spatially controlled Rh distribution can be obtained. Transmission electron microscopy studies of the Pd-Rh cubic nanocrystals show that the products were constructed from Pd cubic cores and Rh nanoframes with both Pd {100} and Rh {110} planes being exposed on the surface, suggesting great potential in catalytic applications.

A wide range of operating parameters and working fluids‚Äîincluding water and dielectric fluids‚Äîcan be used to achieve rapid heat dissipation.","
Effective: Dissipates large heat fluxes via 3D heat spreading and evaporative cooling that could approach kW/cm2 and beyond while keeping the surface temperature under 90oC
Preventive: Mitigates coolant dry-out at the critical heat flux levels that result in a rapid and large temperature rise and thus cause device burn-out
Efficient: Exploits high cooling capabilities associated with phase-change heat transfer through evaporation

Inventors at Georgia Tech have enhanced the inductive power and data transmission using magnetic hyper-resonant coupling among multiple inductive-capacitive resonators. This technology can provide high power transfer efficiency (PTE) and increase the signal to noise and interference ratio (SNIR) of the wireless transponders.¬† This enables lower power consumption, higher power conversion efficiency, and extended reading range for radio frequency identification devices (RFID). Unlike conventional wireless power/data transmission technologies that use identical resonant frequencies for the transmit and receive coils, the hyper resonance technology uses multiple resonators that are adjusted to frequencies higher than the power/data carrier frequency.¬† The additional resonators increase the effective inductance and permeability of the transmitter, which is similar to the characteristics demonstrated by magnetic metamaterials with positive-permeability. This phenomenon amplifies the magnetic resonance of the transmitter and consequently the overall power transfer efficiency (PTE) of the wireless power transmission link.

CNC composite films combine a low density with a high tensile strength, a high elastic modulus, and a low coefficient of thermal expansion
Researchers¬† from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech have developed a substrate for organic solar cells made of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) synthesized from renewable feedstocks. CNC composite films combine a low density with a high tensile strength, a high elastic modulus, and a low coefficient of thermal expansion. Upon process optimization, they can withstand up to 350¬∞C, which makes them compatible with organic semiconductors processing. Their very low roughness (1.8 nm) and their good transparency make CNC substrates well suited for photovoltaic applications.

With a power conversion efficiency of 2.7%, the electrical performance of the first organic solar cells on CNC substrates is encouraging, especially when compared to similar devices made on glass and with more optimization options to explore. Those solar cells are easily recycled at room temperature, first immersing them in water, in which the CNC substrate disperses. The photoactive layer is then removed in chlorobenzene, leaving as solid residues the metal electrodes (Ag and MoO3). Furthermore, burning of the solar cells leaves only a residue of ashes with metal components, which is an improvement over toxic fumes generated by plastic combustion.

6418,Sustainable Combination Technology Delivers a Long-Lasting Self-Powered Battery ,"Supports a stable self-powered energy unit with the eco-friendly potential of continuous power 
This innovation revolutionizes the traditional role of a battery as an energy storage unit by transforming it into a power regulator. By combining triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) technology that gleans energy from mechanical movement with the highly efficient storing power of a lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery, researchers at Georgia Tech have designed a novel self-charging power unit. In the presence of ongoing mechanical motion, the TENG and Li-ion battery work in concert‚Äîthanks to the novel design of the arched TENG piece and the battery‚Äôs flexible material‚Äîto simultaneously harvest and store mechanical energy.

This technology works with a wide variety of mechanical motion sources, ranging from the ocean‚Äôs ebb and flow to pedestrian foot traffic at a crosswalk. Once the ongoing electrostatic induction is captured by the unit‚Äôs TENG energy conversion component, the Li-ion battery then stores the generated and rectified alternating current (AC). The device could then provide a continuous direct current (DC) to the external load simultaneously. The power unit, with the application of continuous mechanical motion, has been shown to supply 2 ¬µA of direct current with a stable 1.55 V for more than 10 hours without fading. This could enable large volume harvesting or miniaturization for individual use.

This power unit overcomes the traditional battery‚Äôs most well-known problem: supply limitation. Due to its potential for infinite self-powered capability, Georgia Tech‚Äôs innovation can also eliminate the significant waste of batteries and their environmentally harmful chemicals.

Georgia Tech inventors have created a concentrated solar thermophotovoltaics (TPV) system with liquid silicon thermal storage that utilizes the most efficient and lowest cost component technologies and links them together using a liquid metal heat transfer fluid (LMHTF).¬† The system design involves capturing sunlight at high temperature (above the melting point of silicon) in the sensible heat of liquid tin. Then the tin is used to melt a large container of silicon, which serves as a thermal battery. When electricity is desired, liquid tin is used in a heat exchanger to carry the heat from the solidifying silicon battery to a dense array of TPV modules, which can convert the upper portion of the emission spectrum to electricity. The remaining energy in the spectrum is reflected back to the emitter via silver backed mirror. This technology that can use liquid metal (i.e. molten tin) as a high temperature liquid heat transfer fluid, can now solve the power density mismatch problem in TPV and enable a high efficiency design.

6432,Noncoding RNA Targets for RNA Interference,"A broad and extensive new category of targets for interference RNAs (iRNAs) exclusive of mRNA
Inventors at Georgia Tech have discovered a broad and extensive new category of targets for interference RNAs (iRNAs) exclusive of mRNA. They have demonstrated that iRNAs may be used to manipulate biological processes that do not explicitly involve mRNA. New iRNAs can be directed at non-coding RNAs such as ribosomal RNAs (rRNA) and transfer RNAs (tRNA). An iRNA that targets a non-coding RNA is called a non-coding active in interfering RNA (nciRNA). Such nciRNAs cause degradation of non-coding RNAs in vivo and are highly active in biological assays. Because cells are sensitive to disturbances of the translational machinery, nciRNA-induced cleavage of targets other than mRNA, such as rRNA, offers an efficient mechanism to induce mortality in eukaryotic cells and organisms. The nciRNAs can be programmed with the desired degree of specificity, depending on the degree of sequence conservation, to selectively target and kill eukaryotic organisms at a selected phylogenetic level. Thus, nciRNAs can be directed at one species within a complex mixture of organism types.

Hua Wang, Jongseok Park, and Taiyun Chi From the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech created a technology that consists of a fully, re-configurable pixelated antenna array that reduces or eliminates loss and distortion challenges that conventional switch-based tunable antennas suffer. It employs and extends the multi-feel antenna concept by implementing each pixel as an array of electrically small radiators connected with distributed feeds. This design, a switchless reconfigurable antenna array with distributed and co-adaptive multi-feed antenna pixels¬† or ‚ÄúRAMP‚Äù, enables individual configurability of both amplitude and phase at each antenna pixel. It consists of actively modulating the currents at the multi-feeds of the antenna to synthesize the RF current distribution and achieve the desired reconfigurable radiation characteristics.

By eliminating the need for switches or tunable components and enabling reconfiguration of the pixel-level radiation characteristics, the RAMP provides array-level arbitrary polarization, operating frequency tunability, power level and linearity enhancement. These enhancements in the antenna construction results in high-efficiency power combining at the antenna-level and enhanced power handling capacity of the antenna system as a whole.

6478,A Method for Exhaustive CRISPR Off-Target Analysis ,"A method for identifying off-target sites for research and the study of human diseases
Georgia Tech inventors have developed an exhaustive means to search for possible on- and off-target cleavage sites for nucleotide-directed nucleases, such as CRISPR.¬† CRISPR genome editing is currently being used across the globe in academic and corporate research labs facilitating basic research, making model organisms, and modifying plants and animals. Therapeutic use has been described for many disease indications, with work progressing through pre-clinical to the initiation of clinical trials. For each of these uses, the users are interested in maximizing the intended use and minimizing unintended editing effects, including off-target cleavage events. For all of these uses, it is critical that an exhaustive genome search is conducted to identify sites that may be cleaved by the nuclease or nucleases.¬†

An exhaustive search for sites that may be cleaved must include both mismatches in sequence and the possibility of differences in length. These single or multiple difference in length between hybridization regions can be thought of or described as ‚Äúbulges,‚Äù ‚Äúindels‚Äù (insertions or deletions), ‚Äúgaps,‚Äù or ‚Äúskipped bases.‚Äù This technology allows the required inclusion of these searches along with searches for sites with mismatches. Numerous labs have verified that these sites can be cleaved and characterized these events (Lin, 2016).

To facilitate these types of searches, Georgia Tech inventors also developed a method for identifying potential CRISPR-Cas9 off-target sites and facilitating their testing. The method enables searching genomes for potential off-target sites based on the user-supplied guide strand and input parameters. The method identifies potential off-target sites with mismatched bases and, unlike other methods, insertions or deletions when compared with the guide strand. The method aids in the identification and quantification of CRISPR-Cas induced off-target cleavage in cells. A search algorithm can scan a genome in seconds and provides web output in table format, with mismatches to the aligned query sequences marked in red. Links are provided to the University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome browser for each on-target and possible off-target locations to provide additional information on the site and flanking regions. In addition, all results are available for download to an Excel spreadsheet, allowing further analysis, sorting, and oligonucleotide ordering.

6492,Dual-Polarized Antenna for OFDM," Dual-polarized antenna in an OFDM configuration.
Georgia Tech inventors have invented an improved dual-polarized antenna in an OFDM configuration. The invention focuses on reducing an impairment called Polarization Mode Dispersion (PMD) that occurs when OFDM techniques are used in communication devices. By enabling pre-distortion across subcarriers of the transmitted OFDM signal, PMD can be reduced and an associated aspect called Polarization Dependent loss (PDL) advantageously used to improve overall communications capability. ¬†Using the techniques proposed in this invention, the pre-distorted signal captured at the receiver shows improved performance, such as signal power maximization and reduced dispersion, while limiting negative influences on the received signal such as fading. The range of reception of the pre-distorted signal is also improved while simultaneously enhancing the ability to distinguish between signals that are spaced closely together (i.e. signal separation enhancement) and reducing interference. In summary, the PDL that would be present in the signal when it reaches the receiver is controlled (i.e. lowered) by the polarization pre-distortion of the transmitted signal along with maximizing the power of the signal that is being received. This helps in obtaining better data transmission at lower power consumption and more efficient use of the bandwidth to transmit signals wirelessly.

6635,Next-Generation Custom-Fit Reusable Mask for Respiratory Protection,"Designed to eliminate the need for fit-testing and enhance protection (95%) from COVID-19, airborne diseases, and other particulate matter
Georgia Tech‚Äôs patented reusable respiratory protection device is 3D-printed to custom-fit to a user‚Äôs face to potentially eliminate the need for fit-testing‚Äîan expensive and time-consuming task in health care and other workplace settings. The device includes a customized polymer frame that locks in to hold the filter media that provides the required degree of protection, including the 95% filtration efficiency characteristic of N95 respirators. After use, the filter media is discarded, and the frame is disinfected for reuse.

A user‚Äôs face is first scanned to create the profile and structure of the respirator-mask frame, which is then quickly produced via 3D printing technology. The form-fitting facial frame made of polymeric materials is designed to provide effective sealing around the face and prevent any face-seal leakage. Using 3D printing helps ensure a customized and effective fit that enhances device performance and comfort for the wearer.

The custom-fit device can be produced using a combination of material types, and the filter media can be made from various materials, structures, and manufacturing technologies depending on the degree of protection desired. Suitable elastomeric polymer materials for the frame include (but are not limited to) thermoplastic elastomers, styrenic materials, polyimides, synthetic rubbers, polyimides, and silicones. Removable filter media can include materials such as N95, N99, N100, R100, P100, and more.
Because the device is reusable, costs associated with acquisition, storage, and cleaning are anticipated to be one-tenth the cost of a single-use filtering facepiece respirator (e.g., N95).

This technology is a platform for the development of composite precursor hollow fiber membranes that could optimize large-scale gas separation applications. Carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes are known for their permeance and selectivity, and this asymmetric Georgia Tech design of their precursor polymers is intended to make the membranes more dependable and effective.

Specifically, this technology is designed to reduce CMS fiber collapse during pyrolysis while allowing for economical integration into CMS precursor formation. Substructure collapse can result in increased thickness of the separation layer‚Äîwhich often causes a drastic loss in gas permeance‚Äîand its prevention is important for the enabling of practical CMS applications. Tests show that a multilayer CMS precursor hollow fiber with an inner nanoparticle core support layer and an outer sheath layer can eliminate the need for post-treating precursor fibers. Elimination of this additional conventional method for preventing collapse can reduce cost and complexity to the fabrication process.

6725,Method for Making Thermally Conductive Materials,"A method for the production of nanostructured surfaces and bulk composite materials that exhibit tunable surface morphology
Georgia Tech inventors have developed a method for the production of conjugated polymer based nanostructured surfaces and bulk composite materials that exhibit tunable surface morphology, wettability, enhanced electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and total thermal resistance. The nanostructured surfaces are produced via a template assisted fabrication approach using nanoporous templates. Super-hydrophobic surfaces are created, and the control over surface morphology and wettability is achieved by selective template etching. Amorphous polymer nanofibers are produced with thermal conductivities 20 times higher than the conventional bulk polymer material. Certain polymer nanofiber materials maintain their thermal conductivity up to at least 200 C. The arrays of polymer nanostructures are chemically, mechanically, and thermally robust and serve as soft substrates with heat dissipation capability for the fabrication of thermal management materials and tunable wetting for microfluidic applications. Methods are introduced to embed the nanofiber arrays in bulk polymer films to create hierarchical composite structures for use as flexible thermal management substrates, or ordered heterojunction organic photovoltaic cells.

6730,Syntactic Foam For Use As a Noise Suppressor,"A process for manufacturing syntactic foams with micro-sphere inclusions for use as a noise suppression
Inventors at Georgia Tech have developed a novel process for manufacturing urethane syntactic foams with polystyrene microsphere inclusions.¬† The material is designed as a noise suppression component that can be used to replace conventional bladder-style liners in hydraulic systems.¬† Inserting the syntactic foam liner allows more efficient operation in high pressure processes by mechanically reinforcing the microsphere void particles. The process uses a ‚Äúcharge gas‚Äù to over-pressurize the polystyrene microspheres that are infused within the host urethane matrix structure.¬† The special tailoring enhances the overall physical material properties by preventing the microspheres from compressing, shrinking, and stiffening the foam structure. The simple 2-step modification process allows the foam to retain noise reduction compliance at elevated operating pressures of 35 MPa and higher.

Dr. Cohen at Georgia Tech has developed an antenna with high-speed time variation of the conducting path. The antenna consists of a series of segments, and each one is individually controllable.

Georgia Tech inventors have developed a novel gene targeting system.¬† Gene targeting typically is a technique to modify endogenous DNA by homologous recombination (HR).¬† HR is typically inefficient in mammalian cell types; this ultimately limits the effectiveness of HR gene targeting.¬† AGT, however, addresses the challenges associated with HR.¬† AGT provides DNA aptamers that are capable of binding to a site-specific DNA binding protein and mediates the successful exchange of the genetic information between a donor molecule and a target locus.

The frequency of gene targeting was increased in this invention by attaching the targeting DNA to a protein involved in DSB or its repair.¬† This concept was supported by the idea that by bringing the targeting DNA in close proximity of the DSB it would be preferentially used to repair the break, thus increasing the frequency.¬† AGT incorporates a site-specific I-SceI endonuclease that generates a DSB, while repairing and binding to the target locus at the same time. AGT increases gene targeting for aptamer targets, DNA binding proteins, and proteins involved in recombination.

6783,Reducing Vibration During Engine Start,"A strategy based on time-scale separation and command shaping to reduce the powertrain noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) associated with starting/restarting an internal combustion engine
Inventors at Georgia Tech have developed a strategy based on time-scale separation and command shaping to reduce the powertrain noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) associated with starting/restarting an ICE. By tailoring the torque profile provided by the electric machine (EM), the ICE can be started with minimal residual vibrations. The strategy uses a linear combination of constant and time-varying torque components. The time-varying portion of the torque is calculated using an analytical ICE model and a perturbation technique for separating scales and isolating the nonlinear response. Command shaping is then applied to the linear response governed by the remaining scale. Using this technique, effective mitigation of the residual vibrations was demonstrated in a simulation using mathematical models of the ICE and EM. Future work will include the development of a more extensive ICE model and experimental implementation of the concept.

6791,Facile Synthesis of Ultrathin Silver Nanowires,"A simple one-pot method to produce silver nanowires that are less than 20 nm in diameter with aspect ratios of more than 1,000
Younan Xia, and Robson Rosa da Silva from the School of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech have created a simple one-pot method to produce Ag nanowires that are less than 20 nm in diameter with aspect ratios of more than 1000. This is accomplished by confining the nanowire growth in the lateral direction by adding bromide ions and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) with a high molecular weight which acts to ‚Äúcap‚Äù the side faces of the wires while introducing silver nitrate slowly into the reaction vessel.¬† The nanowires had a penta-twinned structure and were obtained in a high yield (90%) within 35 minutes. Specifically, the controlled growth of the Ag nanowires was accomplished by introducing bromide ions from NaBr or KBr and high molecular weight (1,300,000) PVP to act as a capping agent.

Through the optimization of the ratio of the capping agent and the silver nitrate, the researchers successfully demonstrated controlled nanowire growth in the longitudinal direction only. Here, the bromide ions bind to the silver ions to form silver bromide (AgBr). This succeeds in slowing the overall reaction speed by locking up any free Ag ions. This slower reaction rate leads to the preferential formation of penta-twinned, small decahedral Ag seeds that grow into penta-twinned nanowires. The nanowires have significantly reduced localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), leading to enhanced transparency in the visible region of the spectrum. This transparency, coupled with their good electrical conductivity and mechanical flexibility could make them ideal transparent conductive electrodes.

The sensing modalities available for the multi-modality sensor array chip include voltage recording, electrical impedance mapping, optical detection with shadow/opacity imaging or bioluminescence sensing, pH/acidity sensing, and thermal/temperature monitoring. The chip provides multi-modality sensing since at least two modalities can be performed at the same time and can be used to measure multiple physiological signals from a single cellular sample.

6891,Large-Scale Manufacturing and Directed Assembly for Nanowires,"Overcomes the challenges of nanowire fabrication, providing a flexible, rapid and user-programmable technique
Inventors at Georgia Tech have developed a novel process that can overcome the challenges of nanowire fabrication that is flexible, rapid and user programmable. Initially, hollow microspheres are synthesized in bulk quantities via an emulsion templating technique. The walls of these porous microspheres enable facile mass/heat transport while the metal nanoparticles, which decorate the interior, serve as catalysts for nanowire growth. While the microspheres are fluidized in a continuous flow CVD reactor, nanowire voxels grow on the microsphere interior surface. Each voxel is designed with lock-and-key tips and functional blocks that impart the desired properties to the final product. Through the use of entropic depletion interactions that induce a preferential attraction between bodies with complementary shapes (i.e. lock-and-key), the nanowire voxel building blocks are harvested and assembled into larger superstructures.

Georgia Tech inventors have achieved extremely high growth rates in PAMBE growth of GaN while maintaining a smooth surface microstructure.¬† The higher rates were reached with added pumping capacity and a minor modification to the plasma source, while a mixed chemistry plasma showed a further enhancement of the growth rate.¬† Suppression of ion content is achieved by higher plasma pressure and through argon dilution.¬† The maximum achieved growth rate of 9.8 ¬µm¬≠/hour represents more than an order of magnitude increase compared to traditional growth rates in MBE, and even exceeds those commonly used in MOCVD.¬† To overcome a challenge introduced by the higher growth rates, the inventors explored the use of alternative n-type doping methods.¬† The high growth rates, resulting low unintentional doping levels, and excellent uniformity over large areas opens the door for the use of MBE for novel devices utilizing thick indium-bearing layers, as well as existing devices where the traditional slow growth in MBE was previously not viable.

Georgia Tech inventors have developed a screening method for detecting early-stage ovarian cancer. This technology was created using high performance mass spectrometry combined with a customized support vector machine (SVM)-based learning algorithm to identify unique serum biomarkers in patients with early-stage ovarian cancer compared to age-matched controls. A panel of 16 metabolites were identified and changes in the levels of these corresponded to early-stage ovarian cancer with 100% accuracy. This technology has been validated for high specificity and sensitivity for the select biomarkers within the patient cohort. The combined use of SVM machine learning and high-resolution mass spectrometry allows for the identification of unique patterns in large data sets/patient cohorts. Until now, it has been extremely difficult to develop a standardized screen for ovarian cancer due to extensive genetic diversity among patient tumors. Instead of looking at individual mutations, screening for metabolites that are closely associated with a certain cancer could allow for much higher predictive rate.

7032,A Mobile-to-Mobile Remote Computing Protocol for Mobile Computing Devices,"PEEK - a mobile-to-mobile remote computing protocol
Ragupathy Sivakumar and Uma Parthavi Moravapalle from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech have developed PEEK - a mobile-to-mobile remote computing protocol. PEEK is application agnostic as well as operating system (OS) and device independent. PEEK‚Äôs unique value proposition is in the three features it supports: ¬†1) Multi-touch support; 2) Context association and 3) Flexible frame compression. PEEK clients directly capture touch interactions, without a need for mouse translation, in a suitable touch message format to avoid loss of integrity, and send them to the PEEK server for execution. Because the message format is OS agnostic, clients and servers on different OS can communicate with each other.

PEEK clients also capture and transmit various sensor (e.g., accelerometer, gyrometer, compass) readings on the device for building context in a mobile-to-mobile remote computing session. This enables a rich application experience. PEEK‚Äôs frame compression methodology selects one of three compression schemes for use based on factors like CPU load, application type, memory usage, and network bandwidth. PEEKuses video compression techniques when it detects rapidly changing screen content.

7035,Electroactive Polymers with Rapid Switching Rates,"A soluble electroactive polymer using solvent-resistant conjugated polymers
John R. Reynolds, James F. Ponder Jr., Anna M. Osterholm, and Rayford H. Bulloch from the School of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Georgia Tech have developed a soluble electroactive polymer using solvent-resistant conjugated polymers. Initially in their ester form, the polymers are soluble in organic solvents but can be rendered water-soluble through defunctionalization of the alkoxy-chains with an organic or metal hydroxide. It also is highly soluble in other polar solvents, such as dimethylformamide (DMF) but is insoluble in relatively non-polar solvents (e.g., chloroform).

The water-soluble polyelectrolyte form of these polymers can be cast into thin films and further treated with acid to resist solvents, which makes them compatible and highly electroactive in both organic and aqueous electrolyte systems for redox switching. These films demonstrate exceptionally rapid switching compared to similar polymers using typical aliphatic side chains in both organic (LiBTI/PC) and aqueous (LiBTI/H2O or NaCl/H2O) electrolyte solutions.

Peter J. Hesketh, Matthew Ballard, Alexander Alexeev, and Srinivas Hanasoge from the School of Mechanical Engineering at Georgia Tech have developed a rapid method for preconcentration of bacteria in a sample for further analysis utilizing a microfluidic design. The system is comprised of nickel iron magnetic cantilevers and magnetic beads that are functionalized as artificial cilia to provide attachment of biotinylated antibodies to target bacteria in a sample.

7065,Generating Power via High-Efficiency Electrochemical Converter,"A technology to provide more efficient power generation than such current methods as gasoline or thermoelectric generators, photovoltaics, and cyclic compression and expansion engines
Georgia Tech inventors have created a Sodium Thermal Electrochemical Converter (Na-TECC), a two-stage electrochemical, solid-state system that has high efficiency and power density and is scalable to 1‚Äì5 kW. Using two cycles is thermodynamically favorable as it allows for regeneration from the isobaric cooling of the first expansion step and reheat to complete the expansion in the second step, increasing the efficiency of power generation. The Na-TECC directly converts heat into electricity by allowing high-pressure oxidized sodium vapor ions to expand isothermally through two ion-selective solid electrolytes. The free electrons produce power and then recombine with the cations. Once the sodium vapor condenses, a wick pumps the liquid into a high-pressure plenum to begin the cycle again. The converter‚Äôs configuration mitigates the thermal shock experienced across the relatively thin (~ 1 mm) membranes, reduces crack propagation in the solid-electrolytes, and limits the percolation of the molten dendrites. Its geometry improves thermal management by reducing thermal radiation losses. Novel electrodes reduce the overpotential and increase the power production, while a graded wick improves the pumping power.

Using two cycles is thermodynamically favorable as it allows for regeneration from the isobaric cooling of the first expansion step and reheat to complete the expansion in the second step, increasing the efficiency of power generation. The Na-TECC directly converts heat into electricity by allowing high-pressure oxidized sodium vapor ions to expand isothermally through two ion-selective solid electrolytes. The free electrons produce power and then recombine with the cations. Once the sodium vapor condenses, a wick pumps the liquid into a high-pressure plenum to begin the cycle again. The converter‚Äôs configuration mitigates the thermal shock experienced across the relatively thin (~ 1 mm) membranes, reduces crack propagation in the solid-electrolytes, and limits the percolation of the molten dendrites. Its geometry improves thermal management by reducing thermal radiation losses. Novel electrodes reduce the overpotential and increase the power production, while a graded wick improves the pumping power.","
Lower cost: The working fluid and storage materials are inexpensive.
Multifunctional: Multiple functions (e.g., solar conversion, thermal storage, electrochemical storage) can be integrated in a single system.
High efficiency: This device‚Äôs heat-to-electricity conversion has the potential to be twice what has been achieved previously.
Reliable, high specific power: The Na-TECC is capable of generating up to 0.2 kW/kg and includes an integrated storage feature.
20-year cycle life: The use of active scrubbing helps maintain the device‚Äôs performance through 7,000 cycles.
Simple design: This closed system uses radiant and natural convection cooling without water or chemical reactions, produces no vibrations, and is relatively small and lightweight.

7073,Enhanced Dielectric Epoxy for Electronic Devices ,"A method to lower the dielectric constant of epoxy for electronic applications
Georgia Tech researchers have developed a method to significantly decrease the dielectric constant and loss of epoxies by incorporating closed-pores within the epoxy material.¬† The pores are created by modifying the epoxy monomer with a pore-creating component.¬† Upon molding and heat treatment of the epoxy, the porogen reacts and decomposes to create small, closed-pores within the epoxy film.¬† This reduces the risk of cracks and continuous air-pathways throughout the film, which may result in deteriorated mechanical properties.¬† This new epoxy matrix with closed-pores reduces the dielectric constant and loss of the bulk material.¬† ¬†

7096,Grain Structure of Stainless Steel for Anti-Wetting Properties,"A fabrication technique involving anti-wetting properties to stainless steel without applying a coating, while maintaining  stability of the material

Georgia Tech inventors have developed a novel fabrication technique to impart anti-wetting properties to stainless steel without applying a coating, while still maintaining the integrity of the mechanical and thermal stability of the material. The process is a two-step electrochemical etching process comprised of sequentially low and high anodic potentials, resulting in the evolution of intrinsic hierarchical structures that impart enhanced anti-wetting properties to the stainless steel. Using dilute nitric acid as the electrolyte, the potentiostatic electrochemical etching is carried out at a low anodic potential to evolve intrinsic grain structures. A second step of potentiostatic etching step is performed at high anodic potential. The resulting surface shows a hierarchical structure composed of microscale intrinsic grains and enhanced nanoscale surface roughness. Further improvement in anti-wetting properties can be achieved through the application of a thin-film fluoropolymer layer resulting in a 160¬∫ static contact angle and roll-off angle of less than 20¬∫.

7101,Scalable Vapor Condenser for Power Generation ,"A device and method for rapid vapor condensation to minimize energy loss, for applications ranging from electronics to power plants. 
Georgia Tech inventors have significantly increased vapor condensation rates by as much as 60% by applying acoustic actuation (sound waves), such that acoustic energy is transferred to vapor bubbles in direct contact with the surrounding subcooled liquid, causing those bubbles to condense. This acoustic actuation affects the vapor-liquid interface and leads to the formation of small scale surface waves that increase the total rate of vapor condensation. This method is applicable over a broad range of vapor bubble scales, regardless of the size and curvature of the liquid-vapor interface. Ultimately, the increased condensation rate of the vapor can allow for a reduction of subcooling in the condenser, and therefore increase efficiency gains for the overall thermodynamic cycles found in power plants and elsewhere.

Georgia Tech inventors have developed a device and interrogation method for extended range wireless sensing. The device is an inkjet printed reflect-array with Van-Atta operation. The device consists of rectangular patch antennas, which are connected for in-phase reemission in the direction of the impinging interrogation signal. Because of this, the tag can be read at long range from any direction. Unlike standard Van-Atta reflect-arrays, this device involves two degenerate modes of the square patch antenna to reemit the wave with ‚ÄúP‚Äù polarization. This provides improvement in isolation between the signals reflected by the array from the interference due to reflections of the environmental clutter. This device takes advantage of the humidity dependence of the permittivity of this substrate in order to enable it with humidity sensing capabilities. Because of its design, the working frequency of the array is fully determined by the permittivity of the substrate. Its resonance frequency is then determined by interrogating with a frequency sweep to find the frequency that maximizes the radar cross section¬† of the array, therefore determining the working frequency of the device. This frequency is then used to determine the permittivity of the substrate and, finally, the ambient humidity level.

7164,Sutures with Porous Sheaths for Drug Delivery,"A simple and versatile method for creating highly porous sutures which aim to accelerate the healing process of an injury site.
Georgia Tech inventors have developed a simple and versatile method for creating highly porous sutures which aim to accelerate the healing process of an injury site. These sutures are modified to contain an interconnected network of pores, serving to increase the volume of drug loading and allowing for the sustained release of the drug into the affected area. Compared to unmodified suture implants, the porous sutures have the same mechanical properties, but with enhanced drug loading capacity and a sustained release profile of the loaded drug. The modification process of the sutures is simple and conducted in liquid phase at room temperature with low-cost reagents, allowing for easy scale-up in commercial production. The porous sutures not only release drugs for anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, and pain management purposes, but other bio-factors, such as growth factors, adhesives, extracellular matrix components, and cytokines, can be released to facilitate efficient tissue restoration and would healing. This novel invention also has great potential for the repair of load-bearing connective tissues, such as tendons, and can be readily extended to other applications for wound closure and long-term pain relief post-surgery.

Researchers at Georgia Institute of Technology have developed a transformer-based inverted complementary cross-coupled VCO topology wherein the source nodes of the cross-coupled pairs are inherently separated. It achieves a superior phase noise performance, with significantly suppressed flicker noise up-conversion without any start-up degradation. At 1.86 GHz oscillation frequency, the VCO showed a -87.3/-109.1/- 130.2dBc/Hz phase noise at 10k/ 100k/1MHz offsets while dissipating 1.14mA from a 1.5V supply (Figure 1).

7177,Mixed Quantum Dots for HD Displays,"
Sid Malak and Vladimir Tsukruk from the School of Materials Science and Engineering at Georgia Tech have developed an effective technique for fabricating large-area multicolored emissive patterns in mixed quantum dot-polymer films which requires only a single deposition step.¬† This approach uses a mixture of differently colored QDs and a new photopatterning technique, which is in sharp contrast to current photo-patterning approaches that utilize only a single QD component for monochrome patterns.

The method is appropriate for displays based on a patterned array of color filters that form the basis for the color filter subpixels. In this new technique, the color of each subpixel is created using specific photopatterning exposure conditions, with each exposure step being compatible with fast parallel processing techniques.¬† The result is a patterned array of red, green, and blue (or yellow) color filters for corresponding subpixels. The ability to pattern the different colored subpixels results from the difference in absorption between the different color QDs.¬† This size-dependent absorption is a very common feature of QDs and therefore allows this technique to be compatible with the majority of QD compositions currently in use.¬†

QDs can be spatially patterned and easily tuned during synthesis, providing pure emission peaks over visible optical spectrum. The technology opens a simple route for fabricating large arrays of color filters with substantial advantages over the existing nanoscale and micro scale patterning techniques, such as optical and electron beam lithography, inkjet printing, multiple physical deposition steps, etc.

7184,Stiffness Trimming of High Q MEMS Clocks and Oscillators,"A high resolution method to trim the resonance frequency of high-Q single-crystal silicon MEMS resonators coated with a thin-film germanium layer
Georgia Tech inventors have developed a new method to optically trim the resonance frequency of a low-loss micromechanical silicon resonator coated with a thin-film germanium (Ge) layer. A focused UV laser beam locally heats Ge to high temperatures, enabling selective micro-crystallization of SiGe. The stiffness of the optically crystallized SiGe regions decreases with increasing concentration of Ge. These stiffness variations lead to an overall downward shift of the resonance frequency. Large trimming range¬† is demonstrated for low-frequency out-of plane resonant modes. In addition, fine frequency trimming of in-plane Lame mode resonators is achieved without introducing any damping throughout the trimming process, enabling fine frequency control of high-Q micro-resonators. The resonance frequency of a trimmed germanium-coated silicon resonator remains stable after being heated to 450¬∞C for 30 minutes in a Rapid Thermal Annealing (RTA) chamber. Deposition of Ge on Si and growth of SiGe crystals has not introduced any significant damping in low-loss bulk-mode resonators.

This innovation leverages a radio frequency (RF) thermoelectric generator to demonstrate a possible pathway to purely passive radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags that could accommodate distances greater than 100 meters. A thermodynamic analysis on RF-to-DC (direct current) energy conversion indicates that state-of-the-art energy harvesting circuitry is not operating anywhere close to the fundamental physical limits of these processes. At low RF voltage and power levels, this solid-state RF thermoelectric generator (RFTG) device is predicted to outperform conventional circuits at 915 megahertz, with efficiency and output voltage for RF inputs of -30 decibel-milliwatts or less.

This Georgia Tech RFTG illustrates the benefits of considering RF energy harvesting techniques that are not all-electrical in nature. In an age of limitless nanotechnological devices and micro-electromechanical machines (MEMS), other unconventional forms of RF-to-DC conversion with non-electrical intermediary forms may exist that have similar benefits to the RFTG.

7207,DetectIV Offers Noninvasive Early IV Infiltration and Extravasation Detection ,"Early Detection System Needed for Timely Response 
Peripheral IV infiltration and extravasation (PIVIE), which occurs when fluid enters surrounding tissue rather than the vein, can lead to serious medical emergencies whose resolution depends on timely detection. Current detection primarily involves caregivers observing the site every 1 to 2 hours following a protocol or standard of care. There is a need for an early PIVIE detection system when patients cannot notify medical staff about their symptoms, for example, when under anesthesia or undergoing surgery. Early detection is of great importance for neonates and small children, where complications caused by PIVIE are the most severe and rapid responses are essential.¬†
","
Designed with neonates and small children in mind, DetectIV provides a continuous, noninvasive, and wireless PIVIE detection system. Two electrodes connect directly to the device, and two satellite electrodes connect via flexible cable/sled. Different configurations of the device sled allow for a wide variety of placement sites. In contrast with existing limited technologies, the sensor does not cover the IV site and works well with all skin types. It tracks changes in the site‚Äôs bioimpedance using a small, safe alternating electrical current to detect voltage drop and scan the tissue for fluid. As a result of continuously monitoring the site, DetectIV can report infiltration events hours ahead of caregivers.¬†
 ","
Improved surveillance: Continuous monitoring and a wireless alarm system provide automatic and early PIVIE detection.
Convenient: In contrast with existing limited technologies, the sensor does not cover the IV site, allowing caregivers to continue to perform physical tests as needed. DetectIV is also wireless and does not tether the patient to a bedside pole.
Fast notification: Infiltrations and extravasations are detected on average 2 hours ahead of nursing standard of care.¬†
Easy to use: Attaching the device to a patient is quick and easy. First, the sled is placed with two satellite electrodes. Then, the device is placed with the two main electrodes and the sled is magnetically connected. The device magnetically attaches to its sled and charging base.¬†
Improved patient outcomes: Early detection is of great importance to patients at medium to high risk of infiltration/extravasation and can lead to improved patient outcomes and significant cost savings.
","DetectIV is versatile and can be used in hospitals, emergency rooms, surgery centers, and doctors‚Äô offices. Specifically, it is of use to the following populations:¬†

Pediatric and neonatal patients, for whom complications caused by PIVIE are the most severe
Chemotherapy patients, including use with ambulatory pumps for treatment¬†¬†
Geriatric patients, including use in nursing homes and home-based therapy¬†

Georgia Tech inventors have developed a method to simultaneously analyze a large number of cell properties in a biomimetic three-dimensional micro-environment with minimal disruption of cell-cell and cell-material interactions. The high-throughput assay system allows for very high number of replicates measured within a few seconds using already established, and widely available, instrumentation. The developed method utilizes shape and size-specific microgels as model three-dimensional cell niches and combines microgel shape with size and fluorescence, as a novel multiplexing variable in flow cytometry.¬† The addition of shape and size as multiplexing variables is important because fluorescence alone gives very little multiplexing capability compared to hundreds of parameters that can be evaluated using the described technology. Current approaches in evaluating cell-material interactions require the seeding of cells on or in an array of polymers deposited on a glass slide, which is difficult to analyze quickly and is restricted to the examination of fewer parameters and very few replicates.

7241,Deployable Gridded Ion Thruster,"A mechanical method to store a high-performance gridded ion thruster in a small volume spacecraft for efficient storage during launch to orbit
Inventors at Georgia Tech have developed a mechanical method to store a high-performance gridded ion thruster in a small volume compatible with the dimensions of a small (cubesat/nanosat) spacecraft for efficient storage during launch to orbit. Once the spacecraft is ejected from the launch vehicle, the gridded ion thruster is deployed to its full operational geometry and physical size. The small volume of the deployable chamber frees up volume for fuel. Deploying a large ion thruster whose physical dimensions are larger than the platform of a cubesat is advantageous for two reasons. First, the large size of the deployed gridded ion thruster creates a large internal volume-to-surface area ratio in the plasma chamber of the gridded ion thruster, which enables efficient propulsion ionization and high propellant utilization. Second, it creates the required surface area for the thruster to passively cool itself via radiation to the space environment.The design concept for storage and deployment involves the use of elastic, lightweight, multifunctional tiles that are folded and wrapped using slipping folds.

The small volume of the deployable chamber frees up volume for fuel. Deploying a large ion thruster whose physical dimensions are larger than the platform of a cubesat is advantageous for two reasons. First, the large size of the deployed gridded ion thruster creates a large internal volume-to-surface area ratio in the plasma chamber of the gridded ion thruster, which enables efficient propulsion ionization and high propellant utilization. Second, it creates the required surface area for the thruster to passively cool itself via radiation to the space environment.The design concept for storage and deployment involves the use of elastic, lightweight, multifunctional tiles that are folded and wrapped using slipping folds.","

7245,DejaVu: Automated Suggestions for Email Responses on Mobile Devices,"An algorithm that relies on inverse document frequency (IDF) and keyword matching to provide relevant suggestions during reply construction
¬†In search for a method to decrease time spent responding to emails, Georgia Tech inventors have developed DejaVu, an algorithm that relies on inverse document frequency (IDF) and keyword matching to provide relevant suggestions during reply construction. DejaVu‚Äôs system architecture includes its client, information curator, and its information database. The DejaVu client is located on the user‚Äôs smartphone and interacts with the Information Curator on the cloud. The Information Curator maintains the Information Database and retrieves suggestions from it.¬†

The Information Curator parses emails in their entirety and stores them in the Information Database. Each entry in the database is indexed by a set of keywords extracted from it. The text of an entry in the information database is initially converted to lowercase and then split into constituent words, W(i). To capture the core context of the text in the index and to avoid duplicates of words that are close in meaning with each other, every word in W(i) is trimmed to its root. Each entry in the information database is then indexed on the set of roots of words in W(i). The email whose suggestions are to be extracted is parsed and the core context in the form of a list of keywords is extracted from it. The Information Curator then matches the keyword with the index of entries in the information database. The DejaVu client then uses a hybrid push/pull model for retrieving suggestions from the Information Curator.

7246,Pulse Shaping for Radio Frequency Identification Tags,"
Inventors John Kimionis and Manos Tentzeris have developed techniques and an apparatus regarding RF front-ends that control the tag reflection coefficient over time in a continuous manner, thus enabling the generation of arbitrary backscattered waveforms and reduced bandwidth occupancy. Compared to repetitive lobes in rectangular pulses, square root raised cosine (SRRC) and other arbitrary waveforms feature a main-lobe bandwidth in the spectrum occupancy. These waveforms are generated using complex backscatter modulation schemes by exploiting continuous variation of the antenna load, instead of switching between two discrete values. While maintaining low RF front-end complexity, PIN diodes, field-effect transistor (FET), or any other non-linear element with voltage-controlled variable impedance are used to variate the antenna load. The techniques developed are practical for integration with low computational ability devices (e.g. microcontrollers) and allow wireless backscatter communication with high-order and faster data-rate modulation schemes.

The researchers quantified both nerve activation and inhibition through electrophysiological recordings of peripheral nerve activity along with biochemical changes.

In addition, efferent cervical vagus nerve activation enabled by complete afferent kilohertz electrical stimulation nerve block enhances the anti-inflammatory benefits and incomplete afferent kilohertz electrical stimulation nerve block exacerbates systemic inflammation.

Georgia Tech researchers have developed methods for coloring metals without the use of traditional paint.¬† Metals go through a physical vapor deposition or sputtering process, which deposits chemical species onto the surface to create a thin coating on the metal.¬† The color imparted onto the metal is controlled by the chemical species used and the size of the particles in sputtering.¬† Additionally, the thickness of the coating is adjustable based on the angle and orientation of the metal during sputtering.¬† Masks can be applied to the metal to create colors, patterns, and apply logos.¬† This process is irreversible, permanently imparting color on the metal, which will not wear away with time or affect the physical properties of the material.

Georgia Tech inventors have developed a broadband mm-wave mixed signal Doherty TX, with linearity and energy efficiency to support multiple bands for 5G MIMO systems. The Doherty output network with offset lines extends the Doherty power amplifier carrier frequency range and reduce the passive loss at deep PBO. Built-in 360¬∞ mm-wave phase-rotators reconfigures static main/auxiliary phase-offset for further frequency extension. The Doherty power amplifier (PA) employs mixed-signal power cells.

Driven by complex modulated signals, the PA signal bandwidth is largely reduced to ease GHz modulation. The multi-path Doherty PA reconfiguration leads to enhancing TX efficiency up-to 12 dB PBO.The system also uses a computation-assisted dynamic AM-PM feedforward cancellation by mm-wave phase rotators to support GHz modulation. Lastly, the mixed-signal Doherty PA also compensates in-field performance variations, including antenna VSWR.

Enhanced safety: Rather than relying on impact-activated devices, the system issues real-time warnings as soon as the perimeter is breached, providing more time for workers to react and get to safety.
Portable and changeable: The system can be easily moved or adjusted to accommodate changes to the work zone during the day.
Smart analytics: Analysis of intrusion data helps pinpoint areas within the work zone that are more susceptible to breaches, enabling more effective and efficient security.
Reduced costs: Intrusion analytics provide insights for adding reinforcements to only the sections experiencing frequent breaches rather than the entire boundary area, saving costs and time.
Expandable: Designed to be connected to other systems, it can create a short-range, low-power mesh network to extend warnings across multiple work zones.

When mounted onto standard safety barriers, Georgia Tech‚Äôs innovation creates a geofenced detection perimeter that audibly and visually warns workers of intrusions into protected workspaces. Wireless sensors on the safety barriers communicate with each other, sending intrusion data in real time to provide advance warnings for workers in the form of flashing lights and loud sirens. The system also sends intrusion data via Wi-Fi¬Æ technology to a cloud-based or remote server to alert authorities and enable analysis and identification of areas that are more susceptible to intrusion or breaches. The system‚Äôs combination of active and passive methods provides significant enhancement over existing impact-activated devices and passive safety measures.

Georgia Tech inventors have designed a nanoparticle vaccine delivery system that incorporates antibodies as human-derived adjuvants to enhance the immune response of protein nanoparticles.¬† Proof-of-concept studies utilized model ovalbumin protein nanoparticles coated with immunoglobulin M (IgM).¬† In vivo mouse studies showed that the IgM coating significantly enhanced anti-viral Th1 and memory T cell responses compared to uncoated ovalbumin nanoparticles. While protein nanoparticles were used as a proof-of-concept, this antibody coating platform technology could theoretically be adapted to any type of vaccine particulate, including currently-licensed inactivated pathogen vaccines, to boost and extend the lifetime of protective anti-viral Th1 responses.
",,"
Enhance vaccine immunogenicity
Prolong vaccine protection
Reduce safety risks associated with pathogen-derived vaccine adjuvants
Antibody coating platform technology can be adapted to any vaccine particulate (i.e. synthetic nanoparticles, inactivated pathogens, etc.)
","The proposed design can be extended to the use of any nanoparticulates coated with other classes of antibodies to create more effective vaccinations. As the effector functions of other classes of antibodies are elucidated, different combinations of antibody coatings could be used to customize the desired immune responses on a pathogen-by-pathogen basis. According to a recent report, the global vaccine market was estimated at $32.5 billion in 2015 and is expected to double by 2024. Effective adjuvant strategies will be critical for the development of tomorrow‚Äôs vaccines.

Researchers at Georgia Tech have developed a new algorithm for identifying and tracking cell membrane locations. This has the potential to automate electrophysiological measurements such as patch clamping, the ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù of single-cell electrophysiology. The procedure leverages DIC microscopy to examine in vitro brain slices. Data is processed through a novel deconvolution algorithm formulated as a regularized least-squares optimization with the goal of providing automated visual tracking of a target cell‚Äôs membrane to guide automated electrophysiology systems (e.g., robotic patch clamping systems).

Importantly, this unique process can sift through high levels of organic tissue interference and can operate in environments with moving tissue. The algorithm filters out noise in the current image and then deconvolves and segments that image to determine cell edges based on the data from images earlier in the sequence. The final stage is a segmentation based on that deconvolution, which is performed with simple thresholding.

The final stage is a segmentation based on that deconvolution, which is performed with simple thresholding.","
Highly accurate: Overcomes the challenges of tissue interference and movement for precise membrane tracking that can be used for automation
Instantaneous: Surpasses earlier attempts at automating this process by effectively identifying and tracking cell boundaries in real time
High fidelity: Operates efficiently and precisely even in dynamic, high-interference environments

Provides hearing- magnetic fields couple with auditory neurons to produce excitation perceived by the brain was a sound signal
Better sound quality- more precise frequency resolution produces better sound quality
More reliable signal and decreased sound quality degradation- intervening tissues between array and auditory neurons are no longer a carrier for signals, which will prevent attenuation signal interference
Cost effective- non-direct electrical stimulation allows for a greater range of materials that can be used to produce the implantable magnetic array
Multi-functional- aids in hearing but also in treating semi-circular canal dysfunction

To address this challenge, inventors Hua Wang, Song Hu, and Fei Wang have developed a mixed-signal Doherty PA composed of one or more auxiliary branches, each containing multiple amplifiers. The PA‚Äôs digitally controlled analog branches may be turned on based on the amplitude of the input modulation signal, ensuring linear power gain synthesis and increasing linearity. Furthermore, these branches are much more relaxed than conventional digital PA, since the branches use bit number requirements. The main PA‚Äôs analog branch ensures that small amplitude signals can be accurately amplified, thus leading to a large dynamic range. Additionally, the turning point of the auxiliary PA can be precisely controlled to achieve ideal Doherty load modulation, which substantially increases the efficiency. Lastly, sampling images are substantially suppressed due to this mixed signal Doherty operation, compared to the conventional digital PA.

Georgia Tech inventors have developed¬†a robotically actuated 2 degree-of-freedom guidewire with an outer diameter of 0.78mm. The design involves rectangular notches on two sides of a Nitinol superelastic tube of 0.78mm diameter, which act as joints. These joints are oriented at 90 degrees to each other to allow the 2 degree-of-freedom motion. Their most recent prototype demonstrates bi-directional motion capability. Furthermore, by adding these degrees-of-freedom along the length of a guidewire, and at specific locations, customized bending can be enabled at those locations based on the task requirement.

7536,Synthetic Hydrogels for Human Organoid (HO) Generation and Transplantation,"Current HOs rely on tumor-derived extracellular matrices that limit their use in regenerative and translational medicine 
HO technology provides a powerful platform for the functional modeling and repair of genetic defects in human development and in the establishment of chronic disease models, such as inflammatory bowel disease. Current methods for generating HOs rely on growth in a complex, poorly defined, tumor-derived extracellular matrix (ECM). This severely limits their use in regenerative medicine and clinical translation and restricts scale-up applications in drug testing and patient applications. The limitations are caused by the lot-to-lot variations in their composition and structure due to their tumor-derived nature and the regulatory barriers that come with the matrix source (mouse tumor cells).¬†
","
This fully synthetic hydrogel offers in vitro generation of organoids, including intestinal and lung organoids, derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) without the use of natural ECM-based media. This optimal formulation supports hPSC survival, expansion, and epithelial differentiation into intestinal HOs as well as differentiation into mature intestinal tissue in vivo at levels similar commercially available matrices. The synthetic matrix also has potential for use in the development of other HOs.¬†
 ","
Improved HO viability: Based on a four-arm poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) macromer with maleimide groups at each terminus (PEG-4MAL), this synthetic hydrogel exhibits high cytocompatibility and minimal toxicity and inflammation in vivo.¬†
Greater control: PEG-4MAL hydrogel allows control over the matrix composition and its physiochemical properties, while also providing control over gelling time which enables components to be injected as a solution that gels in situ.¬†
Enhanced wound repair: Injectable delivery vehicle supports localized HO engraftment in mucosal wounds to potentially enhance wound closure and repair.¬†
Supports HO development: Engineered PEG-4MAL hydrogel robustly supports HO development and maintenance, with cultures showing the same growth, shape, central lumen, and epithelial budding at the interface with the hydrogel as with commercial matrices.
Supports regenerative medicine: Modular design and ability to deliver via endoscopic techniques creates the translational potential of this delivery platform for regenerative medicine and overcomes limitations associated with the use of commercially available matrices for hPSC-based organoid technologies.

7549,Thermal Resistance Solution for Power Electronics,"A thermal resistance packaging solution with increased mechanical integrity for power electronic modules
Inventors at Georgia Tech have developed a simple method for bonding aluminum nitride (AlN) to aluminum silicon carbide (AlSiC) directly and added a copper layer to the top of the AlN to create an integrated power electronics substrate and cold plate.¬† This configuration reduces the number of layers required for packaging power electronics modules, while significantly reducing thermal resistance and increasing the mechanical integrity. Reduction in thermal resistance can be achieved by eliminating the DBC and thermal interface layers, so that the dielectric layer, AlN, is directly attached to an AlSiC heat sink/cold plate. This modification capitalizes on similar coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) for AlN and AlSiC, and the resultant interface between the layers is subjected to low fatigue stress, as most of the copper layers with high CTEs are eliminated. This method has produced a module with fewer layers and is effective for over 1400 thermal cycles (-40¬∞C to 150¬∞C) without any change in bond strength, where other DBC-based modules fail after 100-200 cycles under the same test conditions.

7591,Rubber Encapsulated Pressure Sensor for Contact Sensing,"A contact force sensor based on a custom elastomer dome with a tailored air cavity adhered to a barometric pressure sensor
Georgia Tech inventors have developed a contact force sensor based on a custom elastomer dome with a tailored air cavity adhered to a barometric pressure sensor. In particular, the shape of the rubber enclosure surrounding the pressure sensor is controlled in order to achieve a desired force vs. pressure signal for the sensor. An air bubble is engineered between the rubber encapsulating the pressure sensor chip (and board) which changes shape and ultimately collapses as the force is applied to the sensor. The shape and collapse of that bubble, along with the entire structure of the rubber encapsulating the pressure sensor, govern the force vs. pressure behavior of the sensor. Similarly, the structure of the encapsulation allows the sensors to withstand inertial effects. As a result, they are suitable for any contact sensing in which the object is also undergoing dynamic movements.

This four-bar leg mechanism uses a cable system to control the movement of the leg, which works in conjunction with a spring mechanism to allow to movements in opposite directions. Two four-bar leg mechanisms are linked together through a single cable whose movement or change in length can be used to actuate each leg independently or in conjunction.¬† Actuators are confined within the system and allow for both symmetrical and asymmetrical movement of the legs in unison.¬† Linking the two leg mechanisms also reduces the loads experienced by each component of the mechanism by distributing contact forces across the entire mechanism.

7595,Increasing Medium-Chain Fatty Acid (MCFA) Yield in Bacterial Host with Engineered Enzyme,"Three-fold improvement in MCFA production for enhanced biopolymer manufacturing
This method for engineering enzymes yields a heterologous thioesterase (TE) that improves medium-chain fatty acid (MCFA) production during chemical and biopolymer synthesis. MCFAs are key intermediates in the synthesis of medium-chain chemicals, including dicarboxylic and hydroxy acids, useful in polymer production. They are not naturally biosynthesized by microbes and their production is hindered by the inefficient expression of plant and bacterial TEs with broad fatty acid profiles.

Georgia Tech researchers have engineered a TE enzyme to interact with endogenous acyl carrier protein (ACP) proteins to achieve a three-fold MCFA yield in E coli. This innovation demonstrates that engineering the interface of heterologous enzymes to better couple with endogenous host enzymes may be a useful strategy for improving the microbial production of chemicals that require the expression of heterologous enzymes. Further, this work sets the stage for sensor-guided engineering of MCFA-producing microbes.

7596,Assistive Stairs Utilizing Energy-Recycling Technology,"Assistive stairs that work by applying the principle of energy recycling
Georgia Tech inventors have created assistive stairs that are an inexpensive, effective option for stair use by applying the principle of energy recycling. The objective with this technology was to design energy recycling assistive stairs (ERAS) that store energy during stair descent and return it to assist the user during stair ascent. Each ERAS is a single stair step designed to be placed on an existing step, with each module equipped with its own latch, sensor, and set of springs. When the tread is fully lowered, it contacts an electromagnetic latch at the bottom and pressure sensors detect foot placement during both ascent and descent. Energy stored in the springs are released back to the user as they ascend the steps. With stair descent being just as energy-demanding and challenging for older adults with a large risk for falls, ERAS‚Äôs are able to assist with the descent process as well. When the springs are removed or their motion is locked, ERAS modules do not recycle energy and are therefore equivalent to a normal set of stairs.

Georgia Tech inventors have designed a system for the identification of erroneous 3D prints through a multi-layer scheme that leverages acoustics, spatial sensing, and imaging techniques to identify internal print errors. This is completed during and after the printing process. The identification scheme bypasses both the controller computer and the printer firmware, and does not require any changes. The acoustic monitoring, done with an inexpensive microphone and filtering software, can detect changes in the printer‚Äôs sound that may indicate installation of malicious software. To create the desired object, the printer‚Äôs extruder and other components should follow a consistent mechanical path that are observed by inexpensive sensors. Variations from the expected path could indicate an attack, sending a signal to the manufacturer. By using the Raman Spectroscopy and computed tomography, researchers were able to detect the location of gold nano-rods that are mixed in with the filament material used in the 3D-printer. Variations from the expected location of those particles indicate a quality problem with the component, which may originate from malicious activity.

Georgia Tech inventors are developing different switch-contact geometries and using finite element analysis to compare the contact geometries with respect to the maximum electric field, mass, and contact resistance. Comparative analysis of different contact geometries (elliptical, Bruce, and Rogowski) have shown advantages over the conventional spherical contacts.

The proposed geometries of Rogowski, Bruce, and elliptical contacts show a reduced field enhancement in the sub-millimeter separation range, which is important for applications with limited contact travel such as piezoelectrically actuated disconnect switches. These contact profiles also have a significantly reduced height compared to spherical contacts, which results in a reduction of bulk contact resistance and mass. These optimized contact geometries are expected to substantially improve the performance of high speed disconnect switches. Long term performance of the proposed contact geometries needs to be investigated.

Comparative analysis of different contact geometries (elliptical, Bruce, and Rogowski) have shown advantages over the conventional spherical contacts.The proposed geometries of Rogowski, Bruce, and elliptical contacts show a reduced field enhancement in the sub-millimeter separation range, which is important for applications with limited contact travel such as piezoelectrically actuated disconnect switches. These contact profiles also have a significantly reduced height compared to spherical contacts, which results in a reduction of bulk contact resistance and mass. These optimized contact geometries are expected to substantially improve the performance of high speed disconnect switches. Long term performance of the proposed contact geometries needs to be investigated.","

7729,Hydrogels for Controlled Delivery of Lysostaphin to Treat Staphylococcus aureus Infections,"Orthopedic hardware infections lack effective treatment options
Orthopedic device infections, most commonly involving Staphylococcus aureus, often lead to implant failure and subsequent removal. Successful treatments are limited because of the inability of antibiotics to mitigate bacterial biofilms, whose matrix provides protection from the host immune system and acts as a diffusion barrier for antibiotics, thereby increasing resistance. Lysostaphin is a bacteriolytic enzyme with high anti-staphylococcal activity that reduces the biofilm and promotes lysis. The lack of an effective delivery method for lysostaphin, however, has limited its use. An injectable method for treating infections with lysostaphin while promoting bone regeneration is needed.
","
This poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogel technology provides a bifunctional material that both promotes repair and prevents failure due to infection. Encapsulating lysostaphin in an injectable hydrogel formulation enables efficient, localized delivery that conforms and adheres to the fracture and surrounding tissue. Enzyme stability and activity is maintained, and anti-biofilm activity is enhanced. Studies indicate that the technology has the potential to effectively eliminate orthopaedic S. aureus infections while simultaneously supporting fracture repair.
 ","
Efficient local delivery: Injectable (or surgically applied) hydrogel formulation conforms and adheres to the fracture and surrounding tissue, ensuring efficient, local delivery of lysostaphin
Higher doses: Localized treatments enable higher relative doses to be given at the site of infection
Potentially fewer treatments: Enhanced stability from the hydrogel carrier may reduce the number of overall doses needed
Greater control: Tunable nature of the material provides control over the amount and time over which lysostaphin is delivered
Faster results: Out-performed prophylactic antibiotic and soluble lysostaphin therapy after 7 days in a mouse model of femur fracture, demonstrating clearance of bacteria and associated inflammation
Potentially higher success rates: Infected fractures treated with lysostaphin-delivering hydrogels fully healed by 5 weeks with equivalent bone formation and mechanical properties to uninfected fractures, while fractures treated without the hydrogel carrier were equivalent to untreated, non-healing infections
","The applications for this technology involve the treatment of Staphylococcal infections, including antibiotic resistant strains.

7745,"Anodically Coloring Molecular Electrochromics (EC) Improve Contrast, Color, and Transitions","Fully transparent, color-neutral states that can switch to a full palette of vibrant colors are difficult with current cathodically coloring polymers
While cathodically coloring polymers provide precise control of color and electrochemical properties, the challenge is in improving the contrast and color saturation. Near infrared light absorption in the visibly transmissive forms of the cathodically coloring polymers causes residual absorption of low energy red light leading to a transmissive grey-blue hue even in the highest contrast materials.
","
These anodically coloring EC molecules provide high contrast with no absorption in the visible neutral state. They are color tunable, which is achieved by manipulating the wavelength and intensity of the radical cation transitions. The neutral states of these molecules are UV absorbing, providing solutions that are colorless and can be oxidized to vibrantly colored radical cations with absorptions that span the visible spectrum, creating green, yellow, red, orange, blue, and magenta chromophores. When mixed, these molecules create transmissive, colorless blends that switch to opaque black solutions.
 ","
	High contrast: Multi-electrochromic behavior offers high optical contrast both in visible and near infrared ranges.
	Tunable color: Broad absorption supports color mixing and color tunability in the charged state. Manipulating the oscillator amplitude of radical cation transitions enables color tuning by shifting the Œªmax of the low-energy absorption by over 400 nm.¬†¬†
	True black-to-clear transition: Molecule neutral states are UV absorbing, providing colorless solutions that can be mixed to create transmissive, colorless blends that can switch to opaque black solutions.
	Decreased energy consumption: Much lower oxidative potentials, as compared to their corresponding polyamides, effectively decreases the energy required for practical EC applications.
","These materials are useful in a wide range of applications where either vibrant color-to-clear or true black-to-clear switching is beneficial:

The novelty of this invention is the consolidation of deposition of multiple liquid solution species into a single process step and scaling of the pattern which is fundamentally enabled by the interaction of the liquid solution species.

Georgia Tech researchers have developed a method to prevent filter fouling using an asymmetric pulse width modulated (PWM) periodic backflush of fluid flow rate, transmembrane pressure, or other flow modulators.¬† The PWM periodic backflush is applied using a fluidic actuator, a mechanism to incite fluid movement, with variable duty cycles, which improves targeted recovery percentage and is found to interrupt cake formation.¬† Additionally, the backflush reintegrates the fouling layer into the bulk of a sample, improving net particle flux for a fixed volume of sample by clearing the cake formation on the filter and restoring the rate of particle flux through the filter.¬† This leads to a higher quality and yield for sample separation that may be useful in particle therapies, tissue engineering, or biological specimen analysis.

7796,A Biomimetic Nose with Machine Learning for Advanced Threat Detection,"Detects trace amounts of agents in both air and liquids at greater distances and at a faster rate than currently possible and without sensor modifications
This new biomimetic nose replicates the mechanics of mammalian sniffing to improve sensing of chemical agents‚Äîwithout the need to modify the sensor. Developed by researchers at Georgia Tech, this technology focuses on moving the gas to the sensor in a unique motion, which enhances sensitivity and detection in both air and water. The ‚Äúsniffing‚Äù of the device causes a brief spike in internal pressure, which pulls the chemical molecules closer to the sensor surface, thereby enhancing detection by the sensor.

The system, known as the Gaseous Recognition Oscillatory Machine Integrating Technology (GROMIT), incorporates machine learning algorithms that use previously gathered metrics and data points to eliminate the need for human programming to address problems. These algorithms create the GROMIT ‚Äúbrain.‚Äù GROMIT distinguishes between samples with similar chemical composition by using the algorithms and the voltage readings that are generated when molecules displace oxygen on the sensor during a ‚Äúsniff.‚Äù As GROMIT is given new samples, it can identify sources based on previous detections.

To enable sensing in liquids, the researchers developed a star-shaped end-effector known as the Marine Olfaction Laser-cut End-effector (MOLE). Its design creates a bubble attached to the star, while deformation of its specifically spaced arms stabilizes the bubble long enough for chemicals to diffuse into it‚Äîeven during multiple sniffs. Together, the GROMIT and its attachment, the MOLE, can provide an electronic nose capable of extended underwater detection.

7841,Synthetic Hydrogel for Satellite Cell Delivery in Dystrophic Skeletal Muscle ,"Current clinical interventions do not regenerate muscle tissue due to aging, trauma, and dystrophic disease 
Muscle satellite cells (MuSC) play a central role in muscle regeneration, but their quantity and function decline through physical trauma, aging, and disease, translating to impaired regenerative potential of muscle and may lead to long-term disabilities and reduced quality of life. Current interventions for muscle trauma ‚Äì primarily muscle flap transfer and surgical suture ‚Äì do not completely regenerate damaged muscle. Clinical strategies to address injured muscle in aging or disease are needed. Interventions targeting the diaphragm are of particularly critical importance, as damage to the diaphragm can lead to breathing difficulties and potentially death. This is the case with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), and other dystrophic disease. Respiratory care, such as mechanically assisted ventilation, remains palliative. Targeting the diaphragm for MuSC/protein delivery is a promising therapeutic avenue but has been challenging due to the thin dimension of the muscle and its deep-seated anatomic location.¬†
","
These engineered hydrogels comprised of synthetic polymers and peptides are designed to enable successful MuSC transplantation to the diaphragm or other dystrophic skeletal muscle tissue, thereby restoring dystrophin ‚Äì a protein absent in DMD and critical to strengthening and repairing muscle fibers. The hydrogels can be loaded with myogenic agents such as MuSCs and/or pro-myogenic factors to form a bioadhesive matrix with optimal mechanical, cell-adhesive, and protease-degradable properties that support MuSC cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. The innovation also includes a cell delivery strategy for treating muscle trauma/deterioration by robust engraftment in cases where intramuscular injections may not be applicable. With positive results shown in mouse studies, the hydrogel-based matrix offers a promising treatment for muscle trauma in elderly and dystrophic patients and represents the first work of its kind to enable targeted cell/protein delivery to the diaphragmatic muscle.
 ","
	Robust: Includes a biomaterial-mediated cell delivery strategy resulting in strong engraftment that provides an option for treating muscle trauma where injections are contraindicated
	Tunable: Matrix stiffness, mesh size, and degradation rate can be adjusted and cell-adhesive ligands can be incorporated, enabling modulation of a range of critical cellular functions, including survival, proliferation, differentiation, and migration
	Flexible: Enables delivery of a wide range of therapeutics, including cells, proteins, and small molecule drugs
	Non-sutured delivery: Uses thiol-maleimide chemistry to covalently adhere cells to the diaphragm (or other muscle) surface without puncturing the muscle, unlike prior (unproven) attempts that required surgically stitching a decellularized scaffold to the diaphragm
	Tested: Demonstrated significantly improved in vivo cell survival, proliferation, and engraftment in non-irradiated and immunocompetent muscles of aged and dystrophic mice compared with collagen gels and cells-only controls
	Adaptable: Provides the opportunity to treat previously unaddressed diaphragmatic deterioration and resulting respiratory failure and may serve as an important foundation for further bioengineering research and ultimately patient care

7880,Novel Pharmaceutical Compounds Based on Tumor-Selective KDM Inhibitors,"Can inhibit cell growth with dramatically enhanced cytotoxic potency for triple negative breast cancer
Novel pharmaceutical compounds have been identified by researchers at Georgia Tech that are capable of inhibiting histone lysine demethylase (KDM) enzymes, globally changing histone modification profiles, and targeting specific tumors.

This research provides new insights into the mechanism of the antiproliferative activities of deferiprone (DFP), a hydroxypyridinone-derived iron chelator currently in clinical use for iron chelation therapy. The data show that DFP derives its antiproliferative activity primarily by inhibiting a subset of KDMs. Its docked orientations at KDM-active sites permit modifications that have enabled identification of a cohort of new DFP-based antiproliferative agents. These agents display selective cytotoxicity against specific cell lines, with one DFP-based KDM inhibitor compound displaying a tumor-selective cytotoxicity potency enhancement as high as 65-fold relative to DFP against the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines tested.

The novel DFP-based KDM inhibitors, with composition-of-matter patent protection, have the potential to be effective tumor-selective cancer therapeutics, particularly for TNBC.

7888,A Low-Loss Broadband Quadrature Signal Generation Technique for Highly Balanced Signals,"Enabling efficient, wide bandwidth for mm-wave applications 
This technology is a novel design for highly balanced quadrature signal generation on integrated circuits across millimeter (mm) wave frequencies. Georgia Tech‚Äôs innovation enhances the phase and the amplitude matching of quadrature signals with lower insertion loss over broader bandwidth than is possible with conventional polyphase quadrature generation methods. The network also has reduced sensitivity to process variations compared to these methods, and each stage of the network enhances the image rejection ratio (IRR). These advances over other quadrature generation methods make it a promising solution for mm-wave applications, as it eliminates the need for extra calibration and tuning.

Georgia Tech‚Äôs network employs two couplers to generate narrowband in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) signals, which are then applied to a quadrature-hybrid ring (QHR) that combines the signals and compensates their quadrature errors. This provides I/Q signals over a broad bandwidth. The network can cascade several QHR stages to provide more balanced I/Q signals. Phase matching at mm-wave frequencies is challenging, since any small length mismatch in the layout will introduce a large phase error. Therefore, a symmetric implementation is essential for providing highly balanced signals at these frequencies. Georgia Tech‚Äôs innovation addresses this challenge with a design that features a common centroid layout for the QHR and the core transistors to provide accurate quadrature signals. Compared to available calibration techniques, this method is more efficient due to superior linearity, frequency scalability, design simplicity, and zero static-power consumption.

7907,Super-Absorbent Polymer (SAP) Beads for Collection of Biofluid Samples ,"Fast and simple method to prolong specimen shelf life at room temperature and lower costs of remote collection for characterization and diagnostics
Inventors at Georgia Tech have developed an improved method of collecting liquid and semi-liquid biological samples (e.g., blood, urine, saliva) for subsequent characterization and diagnostics. Potentially useful for COVID-19 and other disease testing, this technology eliminates the need for refrigeration and has the potential to cut transportation weight in half, significantly lowering cost and complexity. It is poised to help address the urgent need for new advances to provide rapid, effective, and simple remote collection of biological specimens for testing and diagnosis.

The method uses super-absorbent polymer beads to absorb biofluids at the point of collection. Long used in personal hygiene products and in agriculture, pharmaceutical, and biomedical applications, SAP beads can absorb and retain large amounts of liquid‚Äîup to 1,000 times their own weight. The beads can be used to capture specific fluidic components needed for medical analysis (such as enzymes, DNA, RNA, or virus), while the unneeded components (such as blood cells and bacteria) remain unabsorbed and can be discarded. This enables stabilization of the analytical targets for longer shelf life even without cold storage, and it eliminates the need to transport the unneeded components of the sample.

7910,Heterogeneous Integration Method for III-Nitride Devices,"Increased functionality for wide-bandgap semiconductors used in flexible opto-electronic devices
Georgia Tech innovators have developed a technique for large-scale growth and fabrication of III-Nitride (III-N) devices integrated with other technologies to form a high-performance heterogenous system with increased functionality. A key component of the innovation is a mechanical liftoff technique that enables hybrid integration and dicing-free pick-and-place applications.

The technique uses 2D hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as a mechanical release layer and patterned sapphire with a silicon oxide (SiO2) mask to achieve localized van der Waals epitaxy of high-quality gallium-nitride (GaN)-based structures. After process fabrication, devices from micron to millimeter size can be individually placed on a foreign substrate without the need for a dicing step. This approach further reduces h-BN delamination on large-diameter substrates, as each h-BN region is smaller and has independent device structures.

The innovation is scalable for any wafer size, can be applied to other types of nitride-based devices, and is compatible with commercial pick-and-place handlers for mass production. This advance will allow III-N devices to be used more flexibly in a broader range of applications, including flexible electronics.

7915,A Sensor That Converts Everyday Objects into Microphones ,"Thin, flexible, easily manufactured SATURN (Self-Powered Audio Triboelectric Ultra-Thin Rollable Nanogenerator) microphone with self-powered communication
The SATURN self-powered acoustic sensor is thin, flexible, easily manufactured and, when deployed, converts everyday objects and physical surfaces into microphones. Developed by researchers at Georgia Tech, the SATURN microphone uses a triboelectric nanogenerator to transform vibrations into an electric signal without applying an external power source. The simple two-layer design optimizes the microphone‚Äôs sound quality in terms of acoustic sensitivity, frequency response, and directivity, offering improved audio performance compared to similar passive and active microphones.

The SATURN system communicates audio information via analog backscatter using simple circuitry consisting of a printed, flexible antenna and a transistor. Using radio backscatter, SATURN's sensed data is passively transmitted to remote computers, alleviating the need for batteries or any wired power for the material itself.¬†

In addition, by harvesting power from environmental sounds, the SATURN system can flip a bit in a non-volatile memory cell to record the occurrence. Recorded bits can be read later as well as reset using a passive radio-frequency identification (RFID) interrogation system. SATURN can also power longer range radio transmitters to enable real-time alerts for sounds that exceed a certain threshold. For example, the system could store power from sound events lasting several seconds until it has enough to enable a 915 MHz backscatter transmission to the receiving antenna, announcing the event. As long as the event continues to occur, the SATURN system can transmit alerts every few seconds to a remote monitoring station.

The SATURN microphone can be deployed on a variety of surfaces, enabling new opportunities for audio sensing over large indoor and outdoor areas‚Äîboth for mobile and stationary objects. The SATURN microphone may also enable battery-less remote sensing for acoustic events, which has potential applications in controlling noise pollution, enhancing workplace safety, environmental monitoring, and increasing military situation awareness.

Lower cost: The SATURN microphone‚Äôs simpler and less expensive fabrication technique results in lower overall costs.
Better performance: The microphone geometry, attachment methods, and size and spacing of holes are optimized to maximize the recovery of sound and generation of power. This results in better performance compared to commercially available microphones of this type, recovering sound up to 5,000 Hz.

Inventors at Georgia Tech have proposed an alternative electrochemical-based method that produces fixed nitrogen at low temperatures and pressures. This electrochemical nitrate production process has several additional advantages when compared to existing processes. To produce nitrate, nitrogen must be reduced to ammonia, and then ammonia must be oxidized in two processes to nitric acid. This process in particular uses an electrochemical or photoelectrochemical cell that is comprised of an anode (positive terminal) or cathode (negative terminal). When a voltage potential is applied to the electrochemical cell electrosynthesis (synthesis of chemical compounds in an electrochemical cell) can occur.¬† The reactor requires an air saturated electrolyte in order to convert oxygen and nitrogen to nitrate. This has several potential advantages over the competing electrochemical technology of electrochemical nitrogen reduction to ammonia: 1) the process directly utilizes air as a reactant, mitigating the need for air separation, 2) the thermodynamic driving force is substantially lower, and 3) the reaction does not compete with hydrogen evolution, improving the potential selectivity of the process.

7965,High-Performance Broadband Photodetector and Power Generator,"New method for producing alternating current (AC) via the photovoltaic effect, enabling highly sensitive, unbiased optoelectronic devices
Georgia Tech researchers have discovered a method for generating alternating current using semiconductors with various junctions under a flashing light at low bias or without bias. Typically, sensors and power sources leverage the photovoltaic effect‚Äîthe process by which light generates electric current‚Äîto create direct current (DC). The Georgia Tech team, however, found that AC could be produced in the transition states between periodic lighting at the junction of two materials. The production of AC is likely due to the flow of electrons in the external circuit, balancing the potential difference between electrodes as the amount of light energy changes.

The generation of AC electric power in this Georgia Tech photodetector is strongly affected by the intensity of the light source, switching frequency, and size of the illumination area. The current generated through this method is highly versatile, as the process can occur at interfaces of various types of materials and under a wide range of wavelengths. Producing AC power through the photovoltaic effect opens up new avenues for optoelectronic devices.

A Georgia Tech inventor successfully developed an algorithm that can protect caches against eviction-based attacks at an ultra-low cost, in terms of both storage and performance. The[MQ1]¬† algorithm is based on applying an encrypted-address on cache memories for randomization and changing this randomized mapping periodically. The encryption would cause the lines that are mapped to the cache memories to get scattered to different sets of locations in an unpredictable fashion, which is only accessible via an encryption key. Furthermore, to increase security, the algorithm will dynamically change the encryption key, where the contents of the cache are gradually remapped from the old key to the new key. All-in-all, this algorithm provides cache randomizations without requiring any storage tables to memorize the mapping, nor will it slow down the system or require much storage.

Researchers at Georgia Tech have developed a novel system of pristine bismaleimide (BMI) through a unique high-speed shear mix (HSSM) processing method. This method produces material with an impact strength three to four times greater than the typical BMI. While carbon fiber reinforced BMI composites have long been known for their high-strength and heat-resistant qualities, the brittleness of the material makes it vulnerable to impact-induced damage. This centrifuge-based HSSM method, however, rearranges the molecular geometry of the material in order to increase its toughness and significantly reduce its brittle qualities. The resulting BMI plastic overcomes the limitations of conventional BMI and can be reproduced for large-scale utilization in a variety of industries requiring high-performance materials.

This technology also does not require the addition of chemical additives, as is typical in current models for BMI development. Without the need for extensive chemical processes, BMI‚Äôs potential for industry use increases. This Georgia Tech method allows BMI to retain its balanced performance qualities in high-impact and high-temperature scenarios while reducing its risk of damage.

This is done by treating hits on invalidated-lines, also known as ‚ÄòZombie lines,‚Äô as misses to avoid any pattern leaks to the attacker. This eliminates any timing channel opportunity, which reveals the system‚Äôs patterns, for the attacker as both the cache hit and misses would incur the same time period once the line is marked as a zombie line. A cache hit and a cache miss represent if the requested line can or cannot be found in the cache. Overall, the solution is based on marking the line as a ‚Äúzombie‚Äù on flushes and protecting them until the lines are naturally evicted. Furthermore, ZBM requires only 1-bit per cache line, retains OS-based page sharing, does not require application rewrite, and does not incur slowdown.

8010,Self-Titrating Bacterial Protease-Activated Prodrug,"A new strategy to reduce antibiotic-resistant bacteria
This novel methodology is designed to produce antimicrobial peptide (AMP) prodrugs with the ability to self-titrate in the presence of disease-related enzymatic activity. The prodrug includes a cationic AMP locked by anionic peptides and a protease-cleavable linker. Upon proteolytic cleavage of the substrate, the prodrug unlocks to release AMP, creating the mechanism for auto-titration. Release of the prodrug is only activated by the presence of bacteria proteases‚Äîfor example, E. coli outer membrane protease T (OmpT)‚Äîand increased concentrations of bacteria activate higher concentrations of prodrug. In the absence of bacteria, the prodrug remains inactive and inert, eliminating the risk of off-target toxicity.

Georgia Tech researchers modeled bacteria-prodrug dynamics and identified a dimensionless quantity‚Äîthe Bacterial Advantage Heuristic‚Äîthat governs the success or failure of a prodrug, depending on enzymatic activity and bacteria growth. This approach has the potential to spur the development of new prodrugs and improve the clinical administration of existing prodrugs, contributing to the reduction of antibiotic resistance.

8026,Methods for Dynamic Modeling and Closed-Loop Control of Inflammation,"An engineering methodology to model and control the temporal dynamics of immune response
Georgia Tech inventors have developed an engineering methodology to model and control the temporal dynamics of immune response. Current strategies for intervening in chronic inflammatory diseases include local or systemic delivery of mesenchymal stem cells, systemic delivery of antibodies targeting inflammatory cytokines, corticosteroids, and allograft application of placental membranes. Systemic methods, in particular, can lose efficacy and exhibit numerous side effects, such as development of pneumonia. Current approaches are limited to giving, e.g., a single drug for an extended duration, and in many cases do not work or do not have sustained efficacy. Proper temporal evolution of immune activity is essential for restoring or promoting tissue function in a large number of chronic inflammatory diseases and will have application to a number of tissue engineering applications, such as tissue vascularization. Their method, for the first time, conceptualizes immune cell response to external stimuli as a temporal dynamic response taking on the same types of simple black-box model structures (transfer functions) that can be used for modeling and predicting engineered systems. Their approach identifies temporal profiles to deliver one or more drugs that can optimally promote normal immune function.

8031,Scalable Microfluidic Device with Multiple Constriction Channels for High-Throughput Mechanophenotyping,"A straightforward lab-on-a-chip system with parallel channels to minimize idle time
An innovative approach to cell analysis, this technology is a high-throughput microfluidic device that efficiently measures cell deformability. Most importantly, its designed to overcome the challenge of low throughput often seen in current cell mechanics assessment systems. It does this with multiple parallel channels that each feature a constriction zone with sensors to measure the transit time for cells moving through the channels. As a cell compresses to enter a constriction zones, the flow through that channel is reduced to near zero. In this device, the open parallel channels can receive other incoming cells so as to minimize idle sensor time and clogging.

As the cells move through the constriction zones, their transit time as compared to other cells can be used as an indicator of their type and/or state. This Georgia Tech innovation can also be scaled to achieve an even greater throughput volume, with the sensors of each additional branch of channels operating at a unique excitation frequency. This allows for true frequency channelization and separate data streams that can be recorded for subsequent analysis.

This unique notification system enhances productivity and reduces user stress by providing notifications at the precise moment that users are able to act upon the task. Using machine learning (ML), researchers at Georgia Tech, have created a system that uses three types of inputs to present reminders and information to users in the right way and at the right time.

Reminders are categorized as specific calls to action such as ‚Äúthink about,‚Äù ‚Äúresearch,‚Äù ‚Äúexecute,‚Äù or ‚Äúcommunicate,‚Äù while a ‚Äúproductivity dial‚Äù allows the user to indicate their current availability to be productive. Setting a low productivity number reduces their number of notifications, allowing only the highest priorities to come through, while setting a higher productivity number, indicating they are eager to handle tasks, increases the number of notifications they receive. This productivity setting is controlled automatically by biometrics (e.g., a smart watch) or data sources (e.g., an online calendar), or it can be set manually.

If the user is unable to tackle a task immediately, the system uses ML to tap into their past behavior to enable a unique smart-snooze feature. This allows them to reschedule notifications using future contexts, such as their proximity to other people. User context is collected via smartphone sensor data to characterize their current activity, cognitive state, and interruptibility. The ML engine predicts the next best time to send a particular notification based on the user‚Äôs context and what needs to be done.

8051,Quasicoherent Receiver Solution for Improved Signal,"A low cost and efficient quasicoherent receiver with increased sensitivity for high speed optical networks.  
Inventors at Georgia Tech have created envelope detection based quasi-coherent receivers. Envelope detection can be used to demodulate a previously modulated signal by removing all high frequency components of the signal. Quasi-coherent receivers use an LO to produce signal gain, but do not need to extract phase information, resulting in high sensitivity. Instead of using expensive DSP algorithms, these receivers utilize envelope detection for signal extraction. Envelope detection involves electronic circuits that take high-frequency amplitude modulated signals as input and provide an output, which is the envelope of the original signal. Quasi-coherent receivers display a receiver structure that attempts to provide benefits of coherent detection with a fraction of the complexity. This device relies on full-wave rectification, allowing the transmission of higher data rates. Additionally, the design of these receivers provides significantly improved sensitivity over direct detect receivers while still having a simpler structure than classic coherent receivers.

Researchers at Georgia Tech have developed a device for chemical-free water disinfection in municipal pipelines.

Enabling: Can be used in the development of much smaller mass spectrometers than are currently available‚Äîfrom benchtop devices to handheld or even smaller instruments‚Äîwhich would extend their use to applications in which they are not currently cost effective
High-performance: Provides better than unit-mass resolution and high detection efficiency, and operates at much higher pressures than larger mass analyzers, as shown during lab-based simulations
Multi-modal: Allows for several different modes of operation and enables tandem(MS/MS or MS2) or multi-stage/sequential (MSn) mass spectrometry, greatly improving capability compared with other analyzers
Convenient: Can be microfabricated using well-established microelectromechanical system (MEMS) techniques
Impactful: Provides immediate reduction in the size of current instruments, even before miniaturization of the other needed subcomponents (e.g., vacuum pumps, gas handling valves)
Robust: Helps reduce the requirements of vacuum pumps, which are very difficult to microfabricate, with expected effective operation up to 10 Torr

8140,Transcatheter Heart Valve with Multi-Arm Mechanism,"Promoting optimal device deployment for heart valve repair or replacement 
This transcatheter heart valve (THV) incorporates innovative design features and uses a new multi-arm mechanism to displace native heart valve leaflets. It also aids in proper THV deployment and positioning during or in preparation for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Georgia Tech‚Äôs technology addresses a critical need identified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to decrease risk factors associated with thrombosis development in TAVR by helping decrease flow stasis, preventing coronary obstruction, and optimizing THV deployment.

TAVR candidates number approximately 270, 000 patients across North America and the European Union, underscoring the potential impact of further advances in this relatively new treatment for patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis. Reduction of complications such as thrombotic events following TAVR would reduce patient hospitalizations and healthcare resource utilization and improve patient outcomes.

Reduction of complications such as thrombotic events following TAVR would reduce patient hospitalizations and healthcare resource utilization and improve patient outcomes.","Georgia Tech‚Äôs innovation provides three main design advantages, all of which help to minimize the risks associated with TAVR and optimize patient outcomes:

Reduced flow stasis: This mechanism displaces the native valve leaflets away from the THV stent frame, essentially removing its ‚Äúcover‚Äù and allowing blood to move freely through the open stent cells. This can help to significantly reduce flow stasis in the neo-sinus region, thereby reducing thrombus initiation/progression.
Prevention of coronary artery obstruction: Coronary artery obstruction following TAVR is a rare but often fatal complication. In rare cases in patients with unusually large native leaflets or small aortic roots, the large leaflets block the flow of blood to the coronary arteries as the new valve‚Äôs scaffolding opens. Georgia Tech‚Äôs design displaces the native valve leaflets away from the THV stent frame, which can help to reduce this risk.
Optimized THV deployment: The innovation offers dual feedback to aid clinicians in determining optimal THV deployment height‚Äîa key factor in optimizing patient outcomes. As the device‚Äôs ‚Äúarms‚Äù extend against the native vessel wall, they create both tactile feedback during THV positioning as well as visual feedback via fluoroscopy. In addition to deployment height, the multi-arm design supports axial alignment of the THV with respect to the native vessel wall‚Äîa factor shown to impact valve performance.¬†

Developed as a new THV device
Incorporated into currently available THV devices
Incorporated into new THV device designs
Developed as a fitting and implanted prior to THV implantation

8145,Alternative Plastic Solution Using Chitin Nanofibers,"A method to create plastic films to protect against oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water for applications such as electronics, medicine, or food packaging.  
Inventors at Georgia Tech have created a method for producing plastic films made from poly (glucuronic acid), chitosan, and PEG¬†(polyethylene glycol) to protect products from exposure to oxygen, carbon dioxide, water, and a variety of other gas species. The elements have oxygen permeability lower than PET and water vapor permeability that is similar. The method for fabrication utilizes the TEMPO oxidation procedure to produce poly(glucuronic acid) from cellulose, and allows for crosslinking of chitosan and poly(glucuronic acid), following a heat treatment, into free-standing films. Resulting films have improved flexibility compared to neat cellulose or chitin films. Through utilization of this procedure, the resulting membranes have oxygen barrier properties that are lower than many well-known engineering polymers. This unique extraction and processing method allows for chitin to be formed into self-standing films that can be handled as a single sheet without compromising the properties of the chitin nanofibers. These pure chitin films show high stiffness, strength, and favorable barrier properties to protect against exposure to oxygen, carbon dioxide, water, and a variety of other gas species.This is the first reported use of these three components to form membranes with high oxygen barrier properties.

8185,Foldable Box Kites for Generating Electricity,"A robust box-kite design to better capture wind energy and increase generation significantly. 
Georgia Tech inventors developed a system comprised of foldable box kites to harness wind energy at high altitudes (>300 m). Two foldable box kites are flown to a prescribed altitude by unreeling the tether from their respective spools. One kite, set in generation mode, remains unfolded and ascends further by unwinding the tether from the spool drum. Simultaneously, the other kite is set to retraction mode, where it folds and retracts toward the ground by the winding action of another spool drum that is connected to the first kite‚Äôs spool drum. This rotary motion of the first kite‚Äôs spool drum powers the connected generator mounted on the ground. The efficient and quick folding mechanism of the kites during retraction significantly lowers the aerodynamic forces on the wings, and therefore lowers the energy expenditure for retraction. Upon reaching a specified altitude difference between the two kites, the generation and retraction modes are switched, thus reversing the kites‚Äô vertical movements. By alternating the kites between generation and retraction modes using autonomous control, a continuous positive net power output can be generated.

Inventors at Georgia Tech have developed a method to improve the clash management process through a holistic view that considers the dependency between building components. The project aims to construct dependency structures among building components and uses a component dependency network to improve clash detection by cleaning out irrelevant clashes, grouping related clashes, identifying central components, and analyzing the surrounding environment of clashes. To improve the clash resolution process, the project constructs clash dependency network based on the dependency structures among building components, and then optimizations algorithms are designed to minimize subsequent resolution changes (for example, the number of components that need to be changed). In addition, the project team designs an algorithm for searching the optimal sequence based on the clash dependency network to minimize feedback dependency. Feedback means that post-corrected clashes will impact the pre-corrected clashes, which may cause design rework and iterative adjustments in project practice.

Inventors at Georgia Tech have created a computationally efficient method that computes the multipole moments of molecules and visually represents them as constellation diagrams in a 4D plot, as shown in the figure below. The invention is utilized after a user has successfully computated the partial charge distribution of a molecule in space with a computational chemistry software package. Afterwards, using numerical computing environments, orthogonal spherical harmonic basis functions are used to calculate the molecular multipole moments of the given molecule. The multipole moments are characterized by their degree, order, phase, and magnitude and plotted on the x, y, z axes, and colormap of the 4D constellation diagram. With the multipole moments, other electrostatic properties (electric field, electrostatic potential, etc.) may be calculated and plotted as well. This short run-time process results in an alternative method of utilizing high cost, complex molecular dynamics computer modeling (MD) to characterize the electrostatic properties of molecules. Additionally, users can now digitally encode the properties of molecules, such as those of ligands and receptors, using methods from telecommunications. For example, matched filter systems may be applied with the digitally encoded ligands and receptors to characterize molecular recognition.

The resulting low-cost embedded/wearable system has a wide variety of potential biological and chemical sensing applications.

The micromachined gravimetric sensors will detect whatever molecules can be bound or adsorbed using the surface chemistry that is applied to the device.

To detect gas-phase contaminants, resonators are coated with specific polymeric sensing films that absorb chemicals from the environment. Each resonator acts as a second-order system, where the frequency of its vibration is dependent on both its mass and stiffness. The increase in mass caused by the chemical loading within the sensitive film causes the resonant frequency of the sensor to drop. Tracking the resonant frequency allows one to quantitatively measure chemicals or biological agents present in the surrounding environment.

This drive belt features a surface pattern that minimizes both local and global belt vibrations and self-oscillations in belt driven systems. Georgia Tech‚Äôs innovation addresses the uncontrollable and unstable contact interaction between belt systems and pulleys caused by detachment waves. These waves form in the interaction between a belt and pulley or other surface due to uneven contact forces. This often results in vibration, noise, diminished accuracy, energy loss, and increased wear. All of these deleterious effects can degrade performance and shorten the service life of machine components. Georgia Tech‚Äôs innovative surface texture reduces propagation of detachment waves by locally decoupling contact regions from each other. If one part of a contact surface is disturbed by detachment, the belt does not pass on that disturbance to adjacent parts of the contact surface. As a result, formation of a detachment wave is inhibited.¬†

This tunable active matching network for capacitive ultrasonic micromachined transducers (CMUTs) improves imaging performance in a broad bandwidth. Adding Georgia Tech‚Äôs network at the interface of the CMUT and its electronics reduces acoustic reflections and increases power transfer by negating the effect of the CMUT capacitance.

In simulations, Georgia Tech researchers determined that the optimum impedance condition for maximum power transfer may not coincide with the minimum acoustic reflectivity. So, they included a tunable negative capacitor circuit for CMUTs which would be applicable for device operating both in collapsed and non-collapsed mode. Their innovation is especially useful for collapsed mode CMUTs where capacitance and frequency response changes significantly with direct current bias. Georgia Tech‚Äôs approach ensures that the matching circuit operates at the optimum or near-optimum level as CMUT capacitance changes.

This impedance matching can enhance not only signal-to-noise ratio but also improve the uniformity of the array element response, since it reduces the acoustic scattering and crosstalk between array elements. This network innovation also works with piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducers (PMUTs) and bulk piezoelectric transducers.

This technique produces four-dimensional maps‚Äîspecified by space and time‚Äîof electron density in the lower ionosphere, the ionized portion of Earth‚Äôs upper atmosphere that is often used reflect and transmit radio waves over long distances. Developed at Georgia Tech, the technique uses natural lightning discharges as sources of very low frequency (VLF) radiation. A network of VLF receivers detect these emissions after they reflect between the ionosphere‚Äôs D region (an altitude of 70 to 90 kilometers) and the Earth. This forms a spider web of paths from lightning locations to distant receivers, each providing information about one slice of the lower ionosphere. An innovative algorithm estimates the electron density for each path, and then assembles those many estimates into a three-dimensional image of electron density over a wide region, which evolves with time.

A network of VLF receivers detect these emissions after they reflect between the ionosphere‚Äôs D region (an altitude of 70 to 90 kilometers) and the Earth. This forms a spider web of paths from lightning locations to distant receivers, each providing information about one slice of the lower ionosphere. An innovative algorithm estimates the electron density for each path, and then assembles those many estimates into a three-dimensional image of electron density over a wide region, which evolves with time.","

8355,Novel Electrochemical Method for Extracting Lithium from Seawater,"Shortens the oceanic lithium extraction cycle from years to days 
Taking advantage of the differing electrochemical characteristics of lithium (Li+) and sodium (NA+) ions, researchers at Georgia Tech are extracting lithium from seawater electrochemically using a high lithium-selective polymer sieve on a lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) electrode.¬†¬†

More than 99.9% of the world‚Äôs lithium is found in seawater but in dilute concentrations. Extracting lithium is, therefore, difficult and requires a highly selective process because of the high concentration of sodium ions in seawater. Georgia Tech‚Äôs electrochemical extraction method increases lithium selectivity by using crown ethers to synthesize a 0.09-mm thick lithium-selective polymer (LSP) membrane, which acts as an ion sieve to allow lithium to pass while blocking other ions. ¬†Their surface-treated lithium ferrophosphate (STLFP) electrode has innate properties of lithium-ion selectivity, a fast cycle life, and low environmental impact.

Georgia Tech‚Äôs STLFP and polymer sieve demonstrate great selectivity. Recovered solution has a molar ratio of Li+:Na+ enhanced from 0.2 to 2.15 after just one 2-hour cycle. This method provides a fast and practical electrochemical extraction method for lithium mining from seawater.

8367,Selective Recovery of Valuable Rare Earth Elements and Metals from Coal Fly Ash ,"Highly efficient and environmentally friendly method could produce REEs to meet 100 years of U.S. domestic consumption while reducing CFA waste
This new method for extracting rare earth elements (REEs) from coal fly ash (CFA) not only reduces the environmental hazards and the amount of CFA going into landfills, but it can also produce enough REEs to meet 100 years of annual consumption in the U.S. Developed by researchers at Georgia Tech, this highly efficient method selectively extracts REEs from CFA using a two-phase leaching/stripping process. Following an alkaline pretreatment, the extraction uses a water-saturated hydrophobic ionic liquid and an aqueous salt solution, with REEs selectively leached into the ionic liquid phase. The stripping process then extracts the REEs back into the aqueous phase using a mildly acidic solution. REEs and select metals can be recovered from the acid solution by precipitation and calcination, electrochemical separation, etc. The ionic liquid can be recycled and used over multiple leaching/stripping cycles with no loss in efficiency.¬†
",,"
	Treating a waste as a resource:¬†With REE concentrations in CFA around 500 mg/kg, processing only new CFA produced annually in the U.S could supply over three times the U.S. domestic consumption for REEs. This method is also likely applicable to other wastes.
	Meeting U.S. REE demand: REE demand is expected to increase, as rare earths are essential for the green energy transition, playing critical roles in electric vehicle motors and wind turbines.
	Simplifies the process: Unlike other extraction processes, this method does not require coal ash to be digested prior to separating the REEs‚ÄîREEs are directly extracted from the coal ash and separated from other elements in a single step. Furthermore, this novel process does not require complicated mechanical or electrochemical devices.
	Reduces CFA disposal and hazards: With over 50% of CFA currently being stored in landfills where they create environmental hazards, this innovation presents an opportunity for recycling and a significant reduction in CFA waste disposal.¬†
	Environmentally friendly: The process operates at mild conditions and significantly reduces chemical consumption and waste production. The ionic liquid can be recycled and reused over multiple leaching/stripping cycles with no loss in efficiency.
	Improves efficiency: Compared to the parent coal, the concentrations of REE in CFA are enriched due to the combustion process, making extraction more efficient.

		Renewable energy technologies¬†
		Mining processes and products

8372,LogicFuzzer Cybersecurity Framework,"Accurate and reliable detection of process-destabilizing malware for PLC-based systems
Inventors at Georgia Tech have developed a cybersecurity framework called LogicFuzzer that aims to provide safeguards for programmable logic controller (PLC)-based systems susceptible to malware and malicious code. The framework offers a novel method of overcoming techniques that cybercriminals could use to hide malicious capabilities of code or program inserted into a PLC‚Äôs memory. Specifically, automation representation techniques model program behavior and perform analyses to determine if specific physical processes are being targeted. LogicFuzzer also helps to determine if any program present in the PLC has malicious intent and should be isolated and destroyed. Initial testing demonstrates 98.9% accuracy in detecting the presence of malicious code.

LogicFuzzer works by combining binary analysis, fuzzing, and automaton theory. It first parses the binary programmable logic, extracting specific elements for further analysis when needed. It then creates a high-level data structure from the binary elements, which becomes an emulator for the code execution environment. A fuzzer then generates a complete behavioral model of the PLC program in the form of an automaton. This enables prediction of which process corresponds to the automaton. Finally, the detector component identifies unsafe states and the corresponding paths in the industrial process where these states could apply. This allows LogicFuzzer to quickly identify malicious code, and action is taken to activate the necessary safeguards.

8381,Airy-beam Tomographic Microscopy for Biological Imaging,"A new high-resolution technique for volumetric imaging of cells and tissues
Inventors at Georgia Tech have developed an Airy-beam tomographic microscopy (ATM) technique that allows for scan-free, volumetric 3D cell and tissue imaging using nondiffracting, self-accelerating Airy beams. Conventional wide-field imaging techniques are telecentric, producing orthographic views that require scanning in order to acquire 3D information. In contrast, the self-accelerating propagation trajectory of an Airy beam innately forms a perspective view of the object. Manipulating the Airy trajectories can provide sufficient perspective views to enable the entire volume to be computationally synthesized in a tomographic manner (see the image below). Exploiting highly adjustable Airy trajectories in the 3D space, ATM transforms the conventional imaging scheme in wide-field microscopy, producing a consistent, near diffraction-limited 3D resolution across a ten-fold extended imaging depth. Such a strategy can be readily translated to other non-optical waveforms such as acoustic, plasmonic, and electron waves. The ATM system is potentially applicable to a wide range of biological specimens, spanning molecular, cellular, and tissue levels, thereby offering a promising paradigm for 3D optical microscopy.

8386,High-Caliber 3D and Aerosol Jet Printing with Regenerated Silk Fibroin (RSF),"A new aerosol jet printing method to efficiently fabricate RSF patterns for use in areas such as medicine, food production, and biosensors
Georgia Tech researchers have developed an innovative process to enable use of regenerated silk fibroin solutions with an aerosol jet printer. This method reliably processes silk fibroin material without the need for chemical additives that may negatively alter the mechanical properties of RSF. Additionally, it demonstrates a reduced likelihood for clogging the printer‚Äôs nozzle‚Äîa typical challenge of other processes, like inkjet printing.

The silk fibroin is first processed from its raw form into a printable liquid solution through a unique progression of degumming, dissolution, dialysis, and centrifugation. The solution is then atomized, and the final parameters are tuned before the printed pattern is finally deposited.

8391,Vapor Modification Method for Wood Product Preservation,"Atomic layer deposition technique to manage moisture content, mold growth, and thermal conductivity
Georgia Tech researchers have developed a vapor-phase processing method that makes wood products water repellent, fungal resistant, and more thermally insulating. The method involves using an atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique to apply a thin coating of metal oxide throughout the entire cellular structure of the wood.

The method is an alternative to conventional pressure treatment processes, which involve placing lumber inside a pressurized, watertight tank and forcing chemical preservatives into the wood to protect against rot and mold. The Georgia Tech method uses a single-cycle ALD process to ensure deep penetration of the coating within the wood product. The result is wood that sheds water from its surface and resists absorbing water even when submerged. Because the process requires a single exposure to precursors, it is potentially scalable for commodity product manufacturing.

8393,Bio-Inspired Gripper with Shear-Induced Clamping,"Useful for pick-and-place applications in numerous industrial and residential environments
This new method for manufacturing gecko-inspired adhesive materials could enable mass production and use of the versatile technology in industrial and residential environments. Georgia Tech‚Äôs bio-inspired gripper works without wet or pressure-sensitive adhesives, instead using a wall-shaped hierarchical dry adhesive microstructure that enables it to pick up and release different types of objects. The adhesion comes from elastomeric protrusions a few hundred microns in size that mimic the gripping ability of gecko feet.

Previously, the sheer-activated adhesives were manufactured using template-based molding, with the templates fabricated by complex and costly methods involving photolithography, laser micromachining, and ultraprecision cutting. Georgia Tech researchers have developed a novel drawing-based technique for manufacturing the soft elastomeric thin-film microstructures. The fabrication process can be controlled by such processing parameters as tool speed, time, and displacement during the dipping and drawing stages, making it suitable for mass production. The resulting adhesive microstructures perform better than those produced via conventional molding, and the gripping process does not require high-precision motion control, making it easier to operate in industrial environments.

8408,Heart Valve Docking System with Precision Positioning and Variable Sizing,"Increases eligibility for placement of transcatheter heart valves for up to 80% of patients with tricuspid regurgitation 
This innovative anchoring stent is designed to enable treatment of functional tricuspid regurgitation (TR) in a larger patient population. Currently, size constraints prevent the use of transcatheter heart valves (THVs) in patients with tricuspid regurgitation in the native position, while heterotopic valve implantation can be performed in only 25% of patients. Using this anchoring stent, 80% of patients with TR would be eligible for treatment.

Developed by researchers at Georgia Tech, this technology includes a docking conduit‚Äîthat is, a spacing stent with its distal and proximal sections joined through connecting beams. A stented anchoring conduit is used to secure a THV to the junction of the inferior vena cava (IVC) and/or superior vena cava (SVC) to the right atrium to reduce systemic pressure due to TR.

The distal end has an inner lumen design that conforms to the anchoring surfaces of a THV, in addition to radially extending petals that anchor elements to the vascular junction. The proximal and distal ends have different expansion diameters and/or radial expansion forces designed to enable them to conform to the venous wall of the SVC or IVC.
",,"
Versatile: Enables the THV to function in up to 80% of patients while reducing the current risks of complications, such as embolization
Precise: Allows a THV to be delivered, positioned, and docked at the junction of the IVC and/or SVC and at the right atrium junction
Secure in most any size junction: Compensates for most size differences between the landing site and the size of the THV itself to allow for secure anchoring without the need to create a larger THV
Effective: Reduces the chance of back flow of blood through the tricuspid valve into the venous system, diminishing peripheral and abdominal edema (bloating and pain) and hepatic congestion

Inventors at Georgia Tech have developed a semiconductor work function reference circuit for radiation detection. This detector features circuitry formed by a modified bandgap reference circuit, where the original bandgap reference circuit is designed such that its temperature-independent output is the bandgap energy of the semiconductor used in the circuit itself. Gallium nitride (chosen for its semiconducting and piezoelectric behaviors) is layered with aluminum gallium nitride (GaN/AlGaN) to form GaN high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) devices that are configured to behave as Schottky diodes as the detecting components.¬†

Unlike traditional solid-state particle detectors (SSDs) that measure energy of incident particles through the creation of electron-hole pairs, Georgia Tech‚Äôs device detects particles by recording transient fluctuations in the Schottky barrier height‚Äîdependent on the work function‚Äîof the detecting components that occur due to particle interactions in the material. Notably, the device‚Äôs capability to measure transient fluctuations and use those transient signatures as a mechanism of particle detection offers the potential for more robust radiation detection that is not available in silicon or germanium SSDs.¬†

In particular, the mechanism should result in higher efficiencies and the ability to detect particles of lower energy than is typically possible in other SSDs. In addition, whereas typical semiconductor device behavior is heavily temperature dependent, the circuit used here produces a fixed output voltage independent of temperature variations, supply variations, and loading. This lends confidence that transient fluctuations observed are not due to temperature variations, thus leading to more trusted radiation detection.

This actuator-guided positioning and control system enhances magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) for precision-guided diagnostics and interventional treatments. Used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) applications, the system incorporates an extremely precise positioning mechanism capable of sub-millimeter motions within the MR environment, a high-frequency MRE actuator, and an imaging and control scheme that provides position control and image analysis. This system allows movement of the actuator relative to a region of interest within the bore of an MRI scanner and can create 3D images in near real time to guide procedures.

The Georgia Tech system works with a five degrees of freedom (5DOF) MRI-compatible robot that uses visual servoing to reach a targeted contact and orientation. Accurate positioning of the shear wave fields relative to the area of study is critical and is optimized through position control of MRI-conditional piezoelectric direct drive actuators. The parallel plane mechanism enables accurate use of computer vision data to control the motion of the robot with fiducial markers. A software interface enables visualization of MR images.

The device can be used with an MRI scanner as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for soft tissue characterization through the mechanical property of complex shear modulus/stiffness. For example, in spinal column imaging, this device can be used to understand the severity of intervertebral disc degeneration.

A software interface enables visualization of MR images.The device can be used with an MRI scanner as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for soft tissue characterization through the mechanical property of complex shear modulus/stiffness. For example, in spinal column imaging, this device can be used to understand the severity of intervertebral disc degeneration.","
Precise: Extremely precise positioning mechanism enables orientation and control capable of sub-millimeter motions within the MR environment
Rapid: Significantly speeds up procedure time over standard MRI and offers wavefield images in near real time

This method produces a protective layer or ‚Äúcap‚Äù for semiconductor wafers, enabling the performance-improving promise of hybrid growth processes without the risk of contamination. Georgia Tech‚Äôs invention is designed to protect semiconductor wafers and improve their performance by eliminating the common problem of exposure to atmospheric contaminants, such as oxygen, carbon, silicon, and hydrogen.

Without adequate protection, the wafer may be exposed to contaminants after the first layer is deposited. Georgia Tech‚Äôs method addresses this vulnerability by finishing the first deposition layer with an additional thin layer that can be easily removed during the second deposition without harming the underlying layer. This protective cap shields the device from contaminants during storage and/or transfer between deposition systems. During deposition of the second layer, the cap evaporates, removing any contaminants on its surface. The result is an ultra-clean, contaminant-free surface for the final layer, sidestepping the risk of defects and helping to improve device performance.

Researchers at Georgia Tech have developed a method for producing large and inverted organoids useful for studying the early phases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) breast cancer.¬† Organoids are miniaturized and simplified 3D versions of organs produced in vitro that mimic micro-anatomy. They are useful for studying diseases and their treatments in laboratories.

In DCIS, breast cancer cells reside within the lumen of ducts on the side of the epithelium opposite the basement membrane. An organoid platform with an inverted orientation (also known as a basal-in phenotype) provides direct access to the epithelial surface opposite the basement membrane, significantly aiding in the study of DCIS cancer progression.

Georgia Tech researchers determined that having the epithelial cells self-assemble around and encapsulate a minimal gel scaffold plays a critical role in the inverted phenotype and provides easy lumen access. This cell-assisted scaffolding enables cells to self-organize into patterns with distinct cancer cell populations both inside and at the periphery of the epithelial organoid.

8467,Reducing Intraocular Pressure in Glaucoma Patients Without Drugs or Surgery via a Simple Hydrogel Injection,"Drug-free and surgery-free management of intraocular pressure (IOP) may lower risks and increase patient adherence
Elevated IOP in glaucoma and ocular hypertension patients is traditionally managed with pharmaceuticals or surgery. Drug treatments, such as eye drops or pills, must be taken daily, which is burdensome over the lifetime of the patient and leads to poor compliance. Surgical options, either incisional or laser-based, can be complex and costly, and often lose efficacy with time.¬†

As a new therapeutic approach, hyaluronic acid hydrogel injection to expand the suprachoroidal space (SCS) may allow patients to avoid daily eyedrop delivery or remove the necessity of surgery, even in emergent cases. When neither approach can be avoided, this injection to lower IOP could work as a combination therapy to boost the impact of the required therapeutic or surgical route.
","
Hydrogel injections to alleviate elevated IOP would require one simple office visit every 4 - 6 months with fast results, and extended impact. This drug-free approach was shown effective in animal models for 120 days, with an initial drop in IOP measured within hours of treatment. Additionally, the injection is rapid and can be performed as an in-office procedure and does not require the pinpoint accuracy of lasers while limiting the risk of complications that can result with incisions. There are significant cost-savings anticipated for the patient and/or revenue generation for the clinician with a simplified procedure that does not require daily pharmaceutical care or surgical costs. This technology could also be applied in veterinary sciences thus broadening the market potential.
 ","
	Increased patient adherence: Patients do not need to remember to take their eye drops one or more times per day. Further, the treatment provider knows definitively that the therapy has been delivered.¬†
	Safe: With a singular hydrogel injection via a microneedle, the risk of tissue damage caused by a surgical incision or laser application is eliminated.
	Simpler: Simplifying the treatment process from standard daily drug intake to a brief office visit only once every 4-6 months is easier for patient compliance.
	Fast: The hydrogel injection does not require pre- or post-operative care unlike surgical standard of care and effective IOP lowering can be measured within hours.¬†
	Long-lasting: Expansion of the SCS with measurable IOP reduction for 120 days has been shown in animal studies.

8478,Technique Improves Printing Quality for 3D Nanoprinting,"Broadens industrial applicability for printing micro- and nanoscale structures
GT innovators have developed an optical projection technique that improves printing quality for a novel additive manufacturing strategy, enabling cost-effective, large-scale 3D nanoprinting.

Femtosecond projection two-photon lithography (FP-TPL) is a nanoscale 3D printing technique that fabricates tiny structures a thousand times faster than conventional TPL techniques, without sacrificing resolution.

However, the technique requires tuning process parameters‚Äîincluding photopolymer material properties‚Äîto minimize defects due to over-polymerization. Georgia Tech researchers have altered the optical projection technique to control over-polymerization defects without the need to tune the photopolymer composition. This modification further reduces the aspect ratio of the submicron features from more than 2 to 1.2, resulting in well-defined structures and transforming FP-TPL into a more robust process suitable for high-throughput, high-quality 3D printing of micro- and nanoscale structures.

Working with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), innovators at Georgia Tech developed and functionally characterized 158 nanomolar-affinity mouse monoclonal antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2, using an accelerated immunization and hybridoma screening process. The innovation has the potential to produce an unmatched set of reagents for research and development.

Researchers focused on the receptor binding domain (RBD) with approximately 300 amino acids within the S1 subunit of the spike protein because of its key interaction with the human angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor present on many cell types, especially lung epithelial cells. The research team identified three groups of neutralizing antibodies recognizing distinct epitopes on the RBD motif with high affinity, as inferred from sequence and competitive binding experiments. Additionally, differing functions‚Äîincluding binding of diverse protein epitopes, viral neutralization, impact on RBD-hACE2 binding, and immunohistochemical staining of infected lung tissue‚Äîwere correlated with variable gene usage and sequence.

The researchers further determined that the antibody response to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD can be functionally diverse, which can have significant utility in a variety of applications. Data to support SARS-CoV-2-specific binding include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and label-free binding measurements using recombinant proteins, immunofluorescence in culture, immunofluorescence staining of tissue from infected patients, and virus neutralization assays.

This new system can be used to improve the privacy of facial recognition searches and other forms of biometric-based surveillance and identification (e.g., voice, iris, fingerprint etc.) while maintaining efficiency for demanding applications. Georgia Tech‚Äôs innovation enables users to query large databases that contain biometric data from real-time surveillance in such a way that only the identities of those captured by surveillance sensors and are in the database will be revealed. The system keeps private the identities of everyone else in the surveillance data. In addition, even when a user learns the identity of a person in the surveillance data, the system specifies that the server will learn nothing about either the query or the result thanks to its quantum-safe cryptographic design.

Georgia Tech makes this capability possible with the introduction of two new protocols‚Äîfuzzy labeled set intersection (FLPSI) and its extension, batch-FLPSI (BFLPSI). FLPSI addresses the gap in current privacy-preserving database search technologies that do not accommodate search over fuzzy data such as biometrics. It efficiently computes the intersection of noisy input sets by considering closeness/similarity rather than exact matches. It is the first protocol of its kind to achieve sublinear communication cost relative to a database, thereby achieving efficiency important for databases containing very large numbers of records. Efficiency is further improved with the use of batch-FLPSI, which makes multiple FLPSI queries at the same time at a cost similar to that of a single query.

8507,Generative Causal Explanations for Black-Box Classifiers,"For improved transparency and trust in machine learning systems and results
This novel machine learning technique uses a generative framework to learn a rich and flexible vocabulary to explain a black-box classifier and applies this vocabulary to construct explanations using principles of causal modeling. Developed by Georgia Tech, it enables the complete capture of complex causal relationships while ensuring that resulting explanations respect the data distribution. This use of causal modeling allows learning of explanatory factors that have a causal rather than correlational relationship with the classifier.

The learning framework has two fundamental components to operationalize these causal explanations: (1) a method to represent and move within the data distribution and (2) an information-theoretic metric for causal influence of different data aspects on the classifier output. The learning procedure finds a low-dimensional set of latent factors that represent the data, partitioning the representation into a set of ‚Äúnoncausal‚Äù factors that are irrelevant to the classifier and a set of ‚Äúcausal‚Äù factors that affect the classifier‚Äôs output. Because each point in latent space maps to an in-distribution data sample, the model naturally ensures that perturbations result in valid data points.

Using this framework, a user can understand the aspects of the data that are important to the classifier at large by visualizing the effect of changing each causal factor in data space. They can also determine the aspects that dictated the classifier output for a specific input by observing an input‚Äôs corresponding latent (hidden) values. These latent factors can describe much more complex patterns and relationships in the data than explanation methods that rely on single features or masks of features in input space.
","This novel machine learning technique uses a generative framework to learn a rich and flexible vocabulary to explain a black-box classifier and applies this vocabulary to construct explanations using principles of causal modeling. Developed by Georgia Tech, it enables the complete capture of complex causal relationships while ensuring that resulting explanations respect the data distribution. This use of causal modeling allows learning of explanatory factors that have a causal rather than correlational relationship with the classifier.The learning framework has two fundamental components to operationalize these causal explanations: (1) a method to represent and move within the data distribution and (2) an information-theoretic metric for causal influence of different data aspects on the classifier output. The learning procedure finds a low-dimensional set of latent factors that represent the data, partitioning the representation into a set of ‚Äúnoncausal‚Äù factors that are irrelevant to the classifier and a set of ‚Äúcausal‚Äù factors that affect the classifier‚Äôs output. Because each point in latent space maps to an in-distribution data sample, the model naturally ensures that perturbations result in valid data points.Using this framework, a user can understand the aspects of the data that are important to the classifier at large by visualizing the effect of changing each causal factor in data space.

This technology is an active positioning marker for indoor aerial robots that does not require external infrared illumination, resolving the challenge of excessive reflection in current optical motion capture systems. It consists of a flexible illumination stripe and a compact driver circuit with four small infrared light-emitting diodes (LEDs) integrated at the corners of the illumination stripe. These LEDs emit light at the same wavelength as conventional illumination lamps, which ensures their visibility to motion capture cameras. Built into a flexible substrate, the LEDs are located asymmetrically at the corners of the stripe, allowing the motion capture system to identify the attitude of the robot in 3D space. The constant current in the system‚Äôs driver circuit ensures consistent brightness through a wide range of input voltages.

By leveraging infrared LEDs in these active markers, this Georgia Tech innovation eliminates the need for external lamps that often create a reflection that can be incorrectly recognized as a passive marker. Without the external light source, the LED markers are significantly conspicuous from the background and can be easily distinguished by motion capture cameras, increasing the whole system‚Äôs reliability and accuracy.

This non-invasive device aims to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19 and other viral and bacterial infections. The vest-shaped device applies localized pressure to the chest and back to simulate proning. It was designed to provide an alternative to proning, which involves positioning the patient facedown to redistribute blood to uninflamed regions of the lungs that can still participate in taking up oxygen. Georgia Tech‚Äôs device has the potential to reduce adverse events that occur due to the physical stress on patients of proning as well as eliminate hours of clinical staff effort required for the maneuver. Designed to be used in combination with mechanical ventilation, the vest might also be used for standalone oxygenation support.

Containing independently inflatable chambers, the vest is designed to enable physicians to fine-tune and customize for each patient the redirection of blood to specifically selected locations. An electro-pneumatic system, which is operated via a graphical user interface, autonomously controls the pressure of each chamber, depending on patient needs. Each compartment can be inflated up to 6 psi gauge pressure with precision of 0.1 psi.

Currently, a single vest can accommodate patients with chest circumferences from 35 inches to 60 inches. Constructed from soft thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)-backed nylon fabric and TPU film, the vest consists of three separate pieces that are heat-welded together to simplify the donning process.

8534,A Partial-Hand Prosthesis Simulator,"Facilitating rehabilitative training before and/or after amputation
This first-of-its-kind partial-hand prosthesis simulator (PhPS) is designed to mimic the physical and functional properties of a prosthetic device typically used by those who have had an amputation of the first three fingers at the metacarpophalangeal joint‚Äîthe most common level of amputation of the hand. The simulation provided by Georgia Tech‚Äôs device aims to facilitate learning to aid in prosthesis use both before and after amputation. In particular, the 30-day post-surgery ‚Äúgolden period‚Äù of recovery is a critical time for this learning to take place.

For scheduled amputations, the PhPS is designed to firmly secure the thumb, index, and middle fingers to make them immobile, thereby eliminating their functionality and useful sensation and allowing for simulation of their total loss. This restriction should force the user to effectuate grasp actions in the same way they would post surgery: using wrist flexion and extension to open and close artificial fingers.

In more common unscheduled amputations, the device may allow the patient to train with their functional (intact) hand, acquiring motor skills that may then more readily transfer to the amputated side. The goal is to enable training in prosthesis use while the amputated side is recovering from surgery.

8537,"Hybrid Molecular Catalysts: A New Blueprint for Catalyst Design, Preparation, and Testing ","Homogeneous molecular catalysts cannot be easily scaled up due to complex product separation and catalyst recovery
Homogeneous molecular catalysts enable reaction specificity, which is critical in drug manufacturing and other specialty chemicals. However, these types of catalysts are difficult to scale up due to complexities in final product separation and catalyst recovery. Heterogenizing these molecular catalysts, by attachment to a solid metal-oxide support, could transform the practical utility of molecular catalysts, simplifying catalyst separation and recovery to a filtering and washing process. Previous strategies to heterogenize molecular catalysts have suffered from reduced catalytic activity and leaching (loss) of catalyst, especially in environmentally friendly solvents like water.
","This approach to heterogenize molecular catalysts follows two steps: first attaching the catalyst to a metal oxide support and then encapsulating it with metal oxide via atomic layer deposition (ALD) to prevent molecular detachment from the surface. This versatile method can be used to attach nearly any type of catalyst molecule to an inorganic support because it does not require any specific chemistry. This new hybrid molecular catalyst exhibits unique reactivity compared to a variety of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalyst analogs.Using ALD to create hybrid catalysts via immobilization of molecular catalysts (without concern for their homogeneous reactivity) opens up a new approach and chemical space for catalyst discovery. This new paradigm can improve the attachment and stability of molecular catalysts on solid metal oxide supports, making the catalysts easily separable from reaction solutions and recyclable for repeated use.¬†","
	Improved Reactivity: Attachment of molecular catalysts to solid supports can lead to new reactivity not seen under homogeneous conditions
	Reusable: At an optimal ALD layer thickness, the molecular catalyst remains highly active while still being resistant to surface detachment and subsequent deactivation
	Cost-effective: Catalyst separation and recovery is achieved via a simple filtering and washing process rather than energy- and time-intensive distillation or re-crystallization processes
	Scalable: In addition to the simple filter-and-wash process mentioned above, encapsulation requires only about 10 reaction cycles, making this process technologically and economically viable for large-scale manufacturing

IMUTube is an automated processing pipeline that converts videos of human activity into virtual streams of inertial measurement unit (IMU) data. Georgia Tech‚Äôs innovation is designed to improve the performance of a variety of models on known human activity recognition (HAR) datasets. It can be used to apply existing video repositories to on-body, wearable sensor-based HAR for a wide range of behavioral analysis applications.¬†

¬†

IMUTube provides four essential functions:¬†


	It applies standard pose tracking and 3D scene understanding techniques to estimate full 3D human motion from a video segment that captures a target activity.¬†
	It translates the visual tracking information into virtual motion sensors that are ‚Äúplaced‚Äù on dedicated body positions.¬†
	It adapts the virtual sensors‚Äô IMU data towards the target domain through distribution matching.¬†
	It derives activity recognizers from the generated virtual sensor data, which can be augmented with small amounts of real sensor data in some cases.¬†


¬†

Human curation is needed only for selecting the appropriate activity video content; much of the IMUTube process is automated and applicable to existing videos, thanks to the use of off-the-shelf computer vision and graphics techniques.¬†

¬†

With promising initial test results in three preliminary benchmark studies, IMUTube‚Äôs full potential can be realized through a collective approach involving computer vision, signal processing, and HAR communities. Further work in this area could lead to massive increases in the volume of available real-movement data, making it possible to develop substantially more complex and robust HAR systems with broader scope than is currently possible in the field.

8540,The Sliding-Window Queue-Proportional Sampling (SW-QPS) Algorithm,"Iterative switching for input-queued switches used in routers and data centers
This novel switching algorithm for Internet routers eliminates the batching delays that occur with widely used regular switching algorithms without sacrificing throughput performance. The Sliding-Window Queue-Proportional Sampling (SW-QPS) algorithm employs an innovative framework that computes high-quality matchings, as measured by resulting throughput and delay performances.

SW-QPS uses sliding-window switching, which combines regular switching with batch switching. In this approach, high-quality matches are computed for every time slot then move forward, allowing new matchings to be computed in the immediate next time slot. Because matchings are processed as early as possible, batching delays are eliminated.

The SW-QPS algorithm builds on the achievements of another Georgia Tech‚Äìdeveloped batch switching algorithm called Small-Batch QPS (SB-QPS). Compared to other batch switching algorithms, SB-QPS attains a high throughput performance under various traffic load patterns, using only small-batch-size time slots.

The SW-QPS algorithm enhances the desirable time complexity features of SB-QPS yet offers better throughput performance and delay avoidance.
","This novel switching algorithm for Internet routers eliminates the batching delays that occur with widely used regular switching algorithms without sacrificing throughput performance. The Sliding-Window Queue-Proportional Sampling (SW-QPS) algorithm employs an innovative framework that computes high-quality matchings, as measured by resulting throughput and delay performances.SW-QPS uses sliding-window switching, which combines regular switching with batch switching. In this approach, high-quality matches are computed for every time slot then move forward, allowing new matchings to be computed in the immediate next time slot. Because matchings are processed as early as possible, batching delays are eliminated.The SW-QPS algorithm builds on the achievements of another Georgia Tech‚Äìdeveloped batch switching algorithm called Small-Batch QPS (SB-QPS). Compared to other batch switching algorithms, SB-QPS attains a high throughput performance under various traffic load patterns, using only small-batch-size time slots. It significantly reduces both the batch size and time complexity by matching computation per port via parallelization.The SW-QPS algorithm enhances the desirable time complexity features of SB-QPS yet offers better throughput performance and delay avoidance.","

This smart shield for web cameras (webcams) adds a layer of security by utilizing one of two automated methods‚Äîan electrical-induced film and a motorized cover‚Äîto prevent unauthorized use of a computer‚Äôs camera. Both battery-powered methods obfuscate the webcam lens until the device‚Äôs sensitive phototransistor is triggered by the light-emitting diode (LED) indicator.

This thin-film composite polyamide (TFC-PA) NF membrane has been optimized for improved permeation of valuable nutrients from domestic wastewater while excising harmful emerging micropollutants (EMPs). Georgia Tech‚Äôs novel method used to develop and treat the TFC-PA NF membrane allows for a more precise pore size and narrower pore size distribution of the membrane compared to the current market offerings. The superior pore size characteristics allow an increased quantity of EMPs to be rejected while permitting smaller nutrient ions to pass through, thus obtaining a greater solute-solute separation. Minimizing the EMPs diminishes the likelihood of agriculture absorbing the detrimental compounds, reducing contaminated produce being ingested by the public.

Additionally, this novel membrane has been curated to decrease the density of its negative surface charge beyond market standards. With a nearly neutral surface charge, the TFC-PA NF membrane allows for valuable nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus to permeate the membrane and be of considerable benefit to agriculture when the fit-for-purpose water is used in irrigation.

8655,Biodegradable Shape Memory Polymer for 3D-Printed Tissue and Biomedical Devices,"Biodegradable, Bioresorbable, Soft-Tissue Replacement
Soft tissue pathologies are currently treated with a wide range of materials, however, most of these lack optimal mechanical profiles, are not biodegradable, and/or do not exhibit shape memory behavior to either treat soft tissue pathologies or be used via minimally invasive surgical (MIS) treatment methods. In the simplest terms, existing technologies tend to be either too ‚Äúhard‚Äù (e.g., thermoplastic polymers) or too ‚Äúsoft‚Äù (e.g., hydrogels), with each extreme presenting its own set of problems: too hard can lead to tissue erosion or the eventual migration of the device leading to organ or vessel obstruction, while too soft can lead to implant migration and rapid resorption, which can necessitate repeat procedures.¬†

A major challenge in the treatment of soft tissue pathologies, such as those stemming from acute injury, age-related wear, and disease, is the production of biomaterials that exhibit mechanical properties similar to those of complex soft tissues. Soft tissues display nonlinear elastic and viscoelastic mechanical properties, requiring similar behavior from potential therapeutic biomaterials enabling appropriate tissue repair within and around the pathology. In order to allow for tissue infiltration onto and within the implanted device, these materials should be biodegradable and bioresorbable, ultimately replacing the pathology with healthy tissue and removing the need for a permanent implant.

","
Shape memory polymers (SMPs) are a versatile family of materials developed for numerous applications including heat shrinkable tubing, smart textiles, and actuation for soft robotics. SMPs can be leveraged to treat soft tissue pathologies via MIS procedures as materials exhibiting shape memory behavior can fit in a delivery device, and ultimately ‚Äì upon implantation and exposure to body temperature ‚Äì expand to fit the tissue defect. Novel biomaterials developed to solve the challenge of soft tissue treatment via MIS procedures can leverage the rapidly advancing technology of 3D printing to be able to manufacture patient-specific devices.

This technology utilizes a new synthesis reaction combining a previously described (US8236350 also from Hollister) shape-memory, biodegradable, elastomeric material with photocurable chemistries used in several clinically approved applications. The use of these novel photo-crosslinkable polymers [i.e., poly(glycerol dodecanedioate), or PGD] for 3D printing applications and using direct-write nozzle-based printing and resin-based sterolithography (SLA) printing provides not only patient specificity, but also biodegradability and shape memory behavior allowing the printed polymers to fit within MIS access devices. MIS is rapidly expanding across all healthcare disciplines because of reduced costs and improved patient outcomes. In addition to accommodating design and development of patient specific anatomic devices, 3D printing these materials can accelerate development from prototyping to production for a broad range of soft tissue repair applications.

8658,Advanced Manufacturing of Biodegradable Shape Memory Polymers Increases In Vivo Success,"Greater biocompatibility of polymers needed for biomedical implantations
Biomedical implantations are utilized to restore, replace, or support existing tissue, and in particular for soft tissue repair. Biocompatible devices are used for these implantations in cases ranging from a newborn with a congenital complication to the elderly with endothelial dysfunction. Though minimally invasive techniques are less risky, when introducing a foreign object into the body there is always the possibility of infection or complete rejection, and this must be considered in light of the current antibiotic resistance crisis. Hence, there is a critical need to develop materials that minimize a foreign body reaction and reduce the number repair procedures. For example, patch repair recurrence rate is >50% amongst congenital diaphragmatic hernia patients between 0 years old and 3 years old using the standard of care, Goretex synthetic patch. Each recurrence requiring an additional procedure increases the infection or rejection risk.
","New shape memory polymers offer an improved approach to soft tissue repair because they provide adaptability ‚Äì most important in pediatric patients ‚Äì and can be biodegradable. This technology applies the following innovative physical and chemical modifications to the implants to enable catalyzing repair and regeneration of surrounding tissues for a faster recovery: laser cutting, casting, EDC NHS modification, and porosity. With improved tissue regeneration and cell attachment at a faster pace than existing solutions, the risk of infection or rejection is decreased. Furthermore, the structural (e.g., micropatterns, dimensional patterns) and chemical (e.g., acid and base treatment, solvent casting) adjustments to the polymer reduce recurring procedures for repairs and may prevent advanced clinical antibiotic intervention. Despite the significant modifications, all the methods permit the polymer to maintain its predefined shape. There is cost savings to the healthcare system, manufacturer, and patient while reducing healthcare complications and improving patient outcomes.See also:¬†8655 Biodegradable Shape Memory Polymer for 3D-Printed Tissue and Biomedical Devices","

This detection platform uses double-stranded oligonucleotide probes to detect and quantify viral presence (e.g., COVID-19). In contrast to antibody tests, which rely on the host mounting an effective but delayed immune response to an invasive pathogen, Georgia Tech‚Äôs approach has the potential to identify infection during the earliest infection stages when an asymptomatic host can unknowingly spread the contagion. Unlike conventional flow cytometry samples, samples in this study did not require labeling of RNA targets or any wash steps (reagent use) to remove excess or unbound RNA. Thus, the overall simplicity of sample preparation and testing parameter requirements provides additional advantages to this rapid detection platform. Because this technology does not require high-demand sample collection supplies (e.g., swabs), shortages are much less likely to limit testing. Further, avoiding the use of reagents could reduce the likelihood of contamination seen in earlier tests.

8677,"Scalable, Low-Cost, Inversion-Free Method of Enabling Automated Underside Cell Seeding ","For preparation of high-throughput co-culture tissue barrier models for drug discovery
This density-driven cell seeding method promotes cell attachment to the underside of a flat surface or membrane without the need for inversion by enabling cells to float. The technology achieves flotation by modulating the density of the cell suspension medium so that the cells are less dense than the medium itself. Georgia Tech‚Äôs innovation has been demonstrated in a cell assay using a 96-well model of the small airway-vascular barrier with serum-free, glucocorticoid-free air-liquid differentiation. The polarized epithelial-endothelial co-culture exhibits mature barrier function, appropriate intercellular junction staining, and epithelial-to-endothelial transmission of inflammatory stimuli such as Poly(I:C). Notably, exposure to influenza A virus [PR8 strain] and human beta-coronavirus [OC43 strain] has been shown to initiate a dose-dependent inflammatory response that propagates from the epithelium to endothelium.

While Georgia Tech‚Äôs model focuses on the air-blood barrier, this underside seeding method is generalizable to preparation of various co-culture tissue barrier models for scalable physiologic screening. It can be applied to other organ barriers as well, including the gut, skin, oral mucosa, and other organ systems of interest for drug discovery.

8685,Smart Porous Hydrogels to Increase Cold Supply Chain Efficacy of Biologics and Pharmaceuticals,"Designed to streamline storage and handling of biologics and pharmaceuticals, decreasing costs while increasing accessibility
To increase the accessibility of life-saving medicines and vaccines, researchers have developed Smart Porous Hydrogels (SMH) to serve as polymer-networked vessels for various biologics and pharmaceuticals. The SMH start out as dry units designed to absorb the intended therapeutic or vaccine suspended in water when the two are introduced.

The value of the SMH lies in its absorbency and porousness. Its absorbency is designed to take in a large volume of water that is rich with the intended active components. Meanwhile the network of polymers with a well-chosen biological stabilizer creates a mesh with a specified pore size for a greater uptake of the suspended biologic or pharmaceutical while rejecting a significant number of impurities (e.g., >90% of E. coli, ~80% of S. epidermidis). This selectivity should allow for a considerably high recovery rate when stimuli are applied to the SMH and the active components are freed.

When the level of impurities is low and the recovery rate after stimuli is high, the biodegradation of the biologic or pharmaceutical liquid decreases and should allow for a longer shelf life than the current standard process, even when there is a failure in the cold supply chain. Additionally, by immobilizing the medicine in the SMH, there is less risk that self-degradation would occur in transportation and storage. With the possibility of decreased biodegradation and self-degradation simultaneously, this proposed process may extend the viability of these pharmaceuticals and biologics, resulting in less waste for pharmacies and greater accessibility for patients.

Preservation: With the ability to adjust the pore size of the SMH, researchers may be able to increase the rejection rate of bacteria, thereby protecting the medicine by slowing down biodegradation.
Extended use: Preserving the potency of the transported and stored biologic or pharmaceutical should allow for an improved shelf-life (regardless of the cold supply chain) and an increase in the supply accessible to patients.
Lower cost: Using Georgia Tech‚Äôs SMH for the storage and handling of biologics or pharmaceuticals should minimize the dependence on a cold supply chain, which utilizes freezers that cost between $10,000-$15,000.

Georgia Tech‚Äôs high-throughput MSC potency assay is designed to allow for improved QC actions over the existing standards and permit controlled scalability at a reasonable cost. The QC metric that this technology addresses is the MSC immunomodulatory potential. The current standard tests MSC-mediated T-cell suppression in an MSC:PBMC (peripheral blood mononuclear cell) co-cultures planar assay. That assay does not provide a reproducible result, nor is it agile enough to handle increased sample volumes because of PBMC donor variability.

No cleanroom or costly lithography techniques are used in the fabrication of the device.

8729,"Lightweight, Versatile Cryogenic Conductors","Lightweight, highly conductive alkali metals are too chemically reactive for use as electrical wires
With major aerospace companies working on development of electrical aircraft that use cryogenic fuels, the need is growing for cryogenic conductors with superior gravimetric power density. Current commercially available superconducting wires support very high current densities and conduct electric direct current at zero losses. However, they suffer from drawbacks including geometrical constraints, high manufacturing costs, and difficulty being manufactured in long lengths. Copper conductors do not have these drawbacks, but they are heavy. Alkali metals such as lithium offer more conductivity per unit mass compared to copper but have high chemical reactivity.¬†
","
A good balance between properties can be found in copper-clad lithium (CuCLi) conductors. Because lithium exhibits improved electrical performance at low temperatures, higher conductivity per unit density values can be achieved, making this invention crucial for applications with high gravimetric power density needs (e.g., aerospace). CuCLi wires are lightweight, versatile, and cost-effective and can be used in cryogenic conditions for aircraft and high-frequency applications.
 ","
	Higher current density per unit mass: Alkali metals such as lithium exhibit good electrical conductivity at low mass density, especially under cryogenic conditions.
	Round wires at long lengths: CuCLi wires have an advantage over superconductors in that they can have a circular cross section and can be made at long lengths, making them suitable for windings in motors, generators, and transformers.
	Complex geometries: Unlike superconductors, CuCLi parts can be made to any geometry, making them suitable for cable accessories such as terminations, clamps, feedthroughs, and connectors.
	Versatile operating conditions: CuCLi conductors can operate over a wider range of temperatures, current densities, and magnetic flux densities than superconductors. While the losses increase with higher temperatures, current densities, and magnetic flux densities, there is no critical point at which they stop working.
	Standard tools: Cladding the lithium core with copper enables the billet to be drawn using standard wire-drawing techniques and tools, while protecting the core from chemically reacting with the environment. It also allows the manufacturing of CuCLi litz wires, which are suitable for high-frequency operation.
	Low cost: Lithium is abundant and inexpensive.

8757,Gaussian Switch Sampling (GauSS) for Training Deep Neural Networks,"A dynamics-based active learning approach that matches or outperforms existing strategies
Gaussian switch sampling (GauSS) is an active learning approach for training deep neural networks such as those used by autonomous vehicles (AVs) for object detection and tracking. Developed by researchers at Georgia Tech, the GauSS strategy reduces costs and improves performance by combining prediction switches with both diverse and uncertain sampling components. The technology creates an active learning framework that automatically finds samples that need human annotations. This reduces the amount of data that must be manually annotated and keeps all important data samples for training.

The strategy is anchored by a unifying definition of ‚Äúuncertainty‚Äù and ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù for active learning based on the idea of neural network forgetting. It uses a concept of ""forgetting events"" to differentiate and analyze model interactions with uncertain and diverse samples separately. GauSS outperforms existing strategies on various in-distribution metrics while maintaining valuable robustness characteristics for out-of-distribution data.

Better analyses: It provides a method to analyze models and their interaction with data.
Improved accuracy: By matching or outperforming existing technologies in terms of test accuracy on in-distribution as well as out-of-distribution applications, GauSS is more selective and finds samples that help the network learn as well as remember things previously learned.
Versatile: The strategy is based exclusively on learning dynamics and, therefore, can be generalized across networks, data, and training methods.
Affordability: It requires annotating fewer data and therefore costs less to operate.

These versatile retroreflective metastructures improve the control of higher-order spatial harmonics reflected from binary metasurfaces, which is particularly challenging for steep angles of incidence. By combining multiple resonant metasurfaces and differing lattice spacings, these metastructures increase both their retroreflective bandwidth and angular range. They maintain reasonably high efficiency and dual-polarization, and they greatly reduce the angular precision necessary to produce a retroreflective response.

Developed by Georgia Tech, this technology offers several configuration possibilities to allow for customized metastructures for specific operations. These capabilities are useful for many civilian and military applications, including radio frequency identification (RFID), optical tagging, and smart surfaces for 5G.

Georgia Tech researchers are improving upon currently existing available assay kits for creatinine (a biomarker for renal function) with a portable, low-cost biosensor that uses a cell-free expression (CFE) system and a reporter system that yields a color shift corresponding to the creatine levels. The result is an assay that detects creatinine, creatine, and/or sarcosine molecules enabling point-of-care (POC) quantitative measurement of these biomarkers in biofluid specimens (e.g., blood or urine) without expensive instrumentation.

Creatinine levels play an important role in the assessment of kidney function and determining the course of treatment in chronic kidney disease and other conditions, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and various cardiovascular diseases. Further, any aggressive pharmacotherapy (drug treatment) requires the monitoring of renal function, as the risk of kidney failure is greatly increased while undergoing such treatments.

8784,MIL-101/Amine Sorbents for CO2 Extraction from Air at Cold Temperatures,"Capturing CO2 at Lower Temperatures

Since carbon dioxide (CO2) is the primary greenhouse gas resulting from human activity, improving carbon capture, sequestration, and storage is an important tool in addressing climate change. Most direct air capture (DAC) technologies operate at temperatures of 20 to 40 ¬∞C (68 to 104 ¬∞F), but large portions of the earth have temperatures below 20 ¬∞C, leaving a gap in the world‚Äôs current CO2 capture strategy.
","
MIL-101 is a highly porous metal-organic framework (MOF) used to capture (adsorb) CO2. MIL-101 MOFs incorporating amine moieties are often used to extract CO2 from ultra-dilute mixtures such as ambient air. Typically, these materials are used for adsorption at higher temperatures and/or concentrations, such as with flue gas (combustion exhaust) at power plants or other industrial activities. However, there is no evidence of the use of these MIL-101/amine materials for CO2 adsorption at temperatures below typical indoor, room temperatures of ~20 ¬∞C. Using MIL-101/amine hybrid materials, Georgia Tech researchers have been able to capture CO2 from simulated air at temperatures of -20 to 25 ¬∞C (-4 to 77 ¬∞F), with and without humidity. The research has shown high CO2 uptake selectivity versus nitrogen, and that by tuning the composition of the hybrid or the amine used [branched poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI), tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA), etc.], the strength of CO2 adsorption and the corresponding CO2 desorption temperature can be tuned. The MIL-101/amine materials are tested as powders, incorporated into polymeric fibers or composite monoliths. Small temperature swings can be achieved, including desorption near ambient indoor conditions (room temperature).
 ","
	Increased temperature range: Use of these specific (or any supported) MOF/amine materials enables CO2 capture from air or simulated air at lower temperatures (below 20 ¬∞C)¬†
	Functional in humidity: CO2 capture performance at low temperatures and varying humidity
	Tunable strength/temperature: By tuning the composition of the hybrid or the amine used, the strength of CO2 adsorption and the corresponding CO2 desorption temperature can be tuned
","Because more than 80% of the land in the world has an annual average temperature below 25 ¬∞C, and essentially no place in the world has an absolute humidity of zero, the impact of CO2 capture at lower temperatures and varying humidity could greatly expand potential DAC deployment locations and opportunities.

This technology has demonstrated tumor formation in 100% of injected animals, which is substantially greater than conventional biological matrix vehicles used for tumor implantation work. Additionally, the phenotype of tumor-infiltrating immune cells is highly consistent between formed tumors as well as testing batches. This infiltrating immune cell phenotype can also be modulated based on the composition of the engineered biomaterial matrix scaffold used to more closely mimic different immune responses observed in clinical samples.

Many current tumor model systems used for immune oncology drug screening are prohibitively expensive, highly variable, and slow, making them poorly scalable for large drug screening studies. The engineered tumor microenvironments developed by Georgia Tech aim to improve upon these systems by providing a chemically defined synthetic matrix that results in increased tumor formation rate, decreased disease latency, and diminished variability of immune infiltrates. By enabling immunotherapeutic testing relevant to the variability in tumor immune microenvironments seen in human cancer patients, this invention aims to deliver a robust, consistent, and scalable method for modeling immunologically defined tumors.

This new approach to current spreading in quasi-vertical diodes avoids excessive current flow, field crowding, and premature breakdown at the mesa edges.

8793,Predictive Maintenance System for Large-Scale Operations Offers Potential for Significant Cost Savings,"Current Reactive Maintenance Systems Fall Short

Each year, government and industry make significant investments in maintenance systems that often fall short because they are reactive and disjointed rather than proactive and holistic. Replacing outdated reactionary maintenance and sustainability procedures is a complex challenge because they span several services, platforms, and operations. For large-scale systems, such as aircraft maintenance, the lack of predictive maintenance (PMx) can translate into significant loss of time, money, labor hours, and asset availability.¬†
","
The Strategic, Predictive and Enhanced Analytics for Readiness (SPEAR) offers a proactive solution in the form of a data pipeline architecture for a robust PMx system. SPEAR innovates across the entire pipeline, acquiring critical data, using model-based systems engineering to identify new information, employing a logical decision-making tree to improve upon current processes, and then delivering the resulting information to the end user while reducing their workload. What sets SPEAR apart from existing solutions is that it takes a holistic approach, places a focus on end users, and maintains a modular framework that makes it highly adaptable and applicable across several industries. The proactive nature of the SPEAR pipeline turns unscheduled maintenance into scheduled activities, significantly reducing the negative impact to the organization.
 ","With a core framework of reliable artificial intelligence and machine-learning algorithms, SPEAR provides a proactive PMx system with significant benefits:¬†


	Consistent workflow improvements: Offers repeatable and consistent enterprise-level improvements to the maintenance workflow.¬†¬†
	Proactive readiness: Improves maintenance scheduling, allowing for improved logistics, scheduling, virtual kitting, and part/component availability.¬†
	Customizable: Customers can build and tailor their PMx solutions according to their needs, providing increased data control and an alternative to costly and limited solutions.
	End-to-end solution: Innovates across the pipeline to improve capabilities each step of the way from data capture to end-user interfacing.
	Workload reductions: Acquires, processes, and delivers information to the appropriate personnel efficiently.¬†
	Potentially significant cost savings: Billions of dollars in cost improvements have been estimated for a government application. For the private sector, cost savings are also expected to be significant.
	Workforce and asset availability: Just as important as cost savings, gains of increased resource availability such as labor or decreased asset downtime are significant.

This anti-resonance system (ARS) and ARS blade design reduce vibrations and enable variable speed rotors (VSR) in helicopters and other flight vehicles, which improves efficiency. By incorporating a moving mass mechanism within the rotor blades, the system actively moves the resonance points‚Äîeffectively removing the vibrations that come with VSR. The mass and location of the moving mass are carefully selected and controlled to effectively move the resonance points out of the rotor operating range. This reduces fatigue on the blade and other helicopter components. Variable speed rotors can improve speed and reduce power requirements. For example, reducing the rotor speed from 230 to 150 RPM at ŒºN=0.2 led to a maximum power saving of 41.47%.

Located inside the blade, the sliding mass travels along the length of the blade on a rail and deforms with the blade. This changing location of mass alters the blade‚Äôs mass moment of inertia about its vertical axis, which changes the natural frequency of the blade. Varying the natural frequency, in turn, changes the resonance crossings. In this way, this new blade actively changes the location of its resonance points to prevent the vibrations that would typically be generated.

Monitoring of cell culture bioreactors is critical to process control and optimization for multiple applications, including production of monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, recombinant proteins, stem cells, and gene therapy. Because current automated bioreactor sampling systems primarily use lines of tubing to transfer samples to storage locations, they frequently have issues with cross-contamination and loss of media within the tubing lines. Controlling contamination with these systems requires skilled staff trained in thorough cleaning and maintenance of equipment and an effective preventative maintenance program.
","This gantry-style multi-axis actuator uses a syringe pump end effector to extract samples from an in-line rubber septum that is within a tubing-based system, depositing the extracted samples into sealed cryovials for storage. The disposable syringe can be replaced after each sample to eliminate nearly all possibility of cross-contamination and maintain sample integrity.The system comprises a microcontroller and corresponding electronics that control the horizontal actuator, syringe pump, and a vertical actuator. The vertical actuator moves the syringe pump assembly to retrieve a disposable syringe stored in the storage vial. The samples can then be transferred between, for example, a bioreactor recirculation line and sample cryovial. After the transfer, the disposable syringe can be detached from the syringe pump assembly and the process repeated for the next sample. The automated sampling platform can be used with any type of samples and collection.","
	Maintains sample integrity: Automatically changing the syringe between samples will eliminate nearly all possibility of cross-contamination between samples.
	Simplifies sampling: The automated design includes a processor programmed to execute control of the actuator for sampling at specified times and can be integrated with sensors to trigger samples based on specific sensor readings.
	Reduces costs: In addition to savings related to reduced cross-contamination, automated sampling can further lower costs by reducing hands-on time and speeding sampling.
	Offers flexibility: The platform can be used with any type of collected sample and can be used with a wide range of bioreactors.

Human umbilical cord tissue mesenchymal stromal cells (hCT-MSCs) have been widely evaluated in several clinical trials for treating patients with a variety of medical conditions, including COVID-19.

A key challenge in cell therapy manufacturing is understanding how the bioreactor environment affects cell proliferation and quality.

Based on large-scale commercial bioreactors, this scaled-down system leverages sensors and state estimation models to inform and control CPPs and maintain a more consistent growth environment for cells that is both scalable and reproducible.

8902,Submersible Water Activity Meter (SWAM),"Submerged water activity measurement is problematic due to water contact with relative humidity meters and pressure at depths

Water activity (aw), used to characterize habitability, can be determined by measuring the relative humidity (RH) of an air cavity in equilibrium with a body of water. Measurement requires a vapor chamber housing an RH meter and a route for vapor exchange between the chamber and the water. In currently available instruments, however, the RH sensor must be kept out of contact with the water in order to maintain operation and accurately sense the RH in the vapor chamber, so submerged measurements that can detect changes at varying depths are not possible.
","Building on an earlier design for a non-submersible instrument by Desai et al. (2021), this new submersible device incorporates a permeable membrane that prevents liquid or other media from flooding the chamber while allowing water vapor to enter. This protects the RH meter from contact with the medium, enabling submersion in dynamic environments.To keep the membrane from breaking as the instrument descends and pressure builds, a unique syringe design is used that equalizes the pressure on both sides of the membrane. The syringe is plunged and drawn passively as the instrument moves through pressure gradients.","
	Surveys aw changes: Submersion into the medium of interest enables survey of changes in aw within a water/medium column at various depths.
	Produces fast, onsite readings: Submersion allows rapid determination of aw levels onsite, without returning samples to a benchtop aw system in a lab.
	Enables rapid decisions: In-situ measurement capabilities can inform other kinds of sampling decisions very rapidly, allowing discretionary sample collection.
	Reduces damage and contamination: Use of membrane protects the sensor from contact with the sample and electronics, allowing for repeated measurements with less contamination when used for multiple types of samples.
	Simplifies design: Membrane eliminates the need for complicated valves to prevent water/media from entering the vapor chamber.
	Adapts to pressure: Open upper side of the syringe allows water to compress the plunger while the lower side is the mobile upper wall of the vapor chamber. This prevents overpressure at the membrane and reduces strain. Internal and external pressure sensors verify proper syringe movement.

8903,Recirculation System for Aerosol Collectors Maximizes Particle Concentration for Improved Pathogen Detection,"Collection of Targeted Aerosols is Currently Limited

Typical aerosol wet sampling collection systems (e.g., wetted wall aerosol sampling cyclones) inject clean collection buffer into the aerosol collection device for the duration of the collection cycle. This is a one-way collection buffer, and the concentration of target particles in the aerosol is limited by the minimum flowrate of liquid from the syringe pump.¬†

Collecting a higher concentration of target aerosol particles improves pathogen detection after collection. This innovative recirculation technology maximizes target particle concentration and can be tailored to fit existing off-the-shelf aerosol collection systems. The technology‚Äôs two-pump system continuously circulates buffer fluid to concentrate particles in the hydrosol solution. The system allows users to increase the buffer volume during collection without interrupting recirculation. Recirculating the collection buffer enables the capture of very small numbers of bacteria entering an area.¬†

8918,Biologically Inspired Connected Advanced Driver Assistance System ,"Connecting vehicle systems for collision

This biologically inspired connected advanced driver assistance system (BICADAS) leverages phenomena common in the animal kingdom to improve vehicle crash avoidance. Georgia Tech‚Äôs software-based innovation provides a logical progression to improvements in currently available capabilities by connecting ADAS among vehicles and fixed systems and contributing to the goal of development of autonomous vehicles. The system can also be used to provide significant crash avoidance improvements among non-connected vehicles as well.¬†¬†
","The software-based innovation leverages the animal wisdom of aposematism and bargaining. Aposematism is a biological system in which a hunted animal employs visual anti-predator signaling to warn the predator that an attack will likely result in negative outcomes for the aggressor. The BICADAS provides aposematism-inspired operations to connect vehicles using existing ADAS infrastructure (e.g., front and rear vehicle sensors, cameras, turn and brake lights, etc.) and interface circuitry (e.g., relay logic controllers, wiring, etc.). For instance, the BICADAS can deploy a vehicle‚Äôs front and rear sensors to actively monitor the area around the vehicle to determine, signal, and take corrective action if another vehicle is approaching too quickly, following too closely, rapidly slowing down, etc.The system employs bargaining among the vehicles to find the best course of action, taking into account whether each vehicle is using an active system (e.g., the vehicles are connected via BICADAS or ADAS) or passive (e.g., no ADAS capabilities). The system could visually signal an aggressive driver of a non-connected vehicle to slow down and/or move away, while connected vehicles could transmit information about speed and following distance to signal drivers to the correct action or take autonomous action if the driver does not respond appropriately.Inspired by forms of visual signals used in biology (e.g., those with high contrast and those with changing patterns/blinks vs static patterns are better detected), the BICADAS can provide distinct light patterns and flashes to indicate available lane changes or other directions to avoid a crash. These capabilities are designed to provide faster driver reaction to improve crash avoidance. In addition, while ADAS in general may help to decrease travel times and reduce traffic congestion (and thereby reduce carbon emissions), the BICADAS helps to augment these benefits through the inclusion of traffic bargaining and negotiation where current collision avoidance tools are limited to emergency braking. BICADAS can often be implemented with inexpensive software upgrades. In fact, by leveraging existing ADAS systems, BICADAS can be implemented in 20% of vehicles already on the road and other vehicles can typically be upgraded to include the system for less than $500. This would allow vehicle manufacturers to avoid major hardware or technology upgrades ‚Äì an important consideration given studies indicating that ADAS technologies typically cost more than consumers are willing to spend on them (Source: Boston Consulting Group, 2015).","

8933,Cost-Effective Hydra Method Monitors DRAM Memory in Computers,"Row-Hammer Security Vulnerability Is a Fault in DRAM Modules in Computers
Random access memory (RAM) is a key component that impacts computers‚Äô performance. RAM provides applications with a place to store and access data on a real-time basis. Dynamic RAM (DRAM) is a common type of RAM currently used in desktops and laptops. Despite years of research, DRAM systems are increasingly plagued by Row-Hammer (RH) security vulnerability. Current RH solutions that rely on static RAM (SRAM) incur impractical storage overheads that are not appealing for commercial adoption. Other solutions that store per-row metadata in the RAM space cause significant slowdown in performance. As such, there is a need for a viable solution to mitigate RH, as DRAM is a commodity part widely used in all computer systems.
","
Hydra, a hybrid tracker for RH mitigation, combines the best of both SRAM and DRAM to enable low-cost RH mitigation at ultra-low thresholds. Hydra is composed of two structures: (1) an SRAM-based structure that tracks aggregated counts of a group of rows and (2) a per-row tracker stored in the DRAM array that is only used for the small number of rows that exceed the tracking capability of the SRAM-based structure. Using the per-row tracker in this way limits performance overheads. Hydra enables robust RH mitigation while incurring an SRAM overhead of only 28 KB per-rank and an average slowdown of only 0.7%.¬†
 ","
	Complete solution: Hydra combines the best of SRAM-tracking (low performance overhead) and DRAM-tracking (low SRAM overhead and flexibility of tracking all rows) to produce the only RH mitigation that is effective at ultra-low thresholds.¬†
	Proven robust security results: By looking at the aggregate count and specific rows of data, Hydra provides system analysis that successfully mitigates RH security vulnerability.¬†
	Cost-effective: Compared to existing technologies, Hydra is low cost in terms of both storage and performance.¬†
	Maintains system functionality: Hydra is effective and does not compromise the functionality of the system because the slowdown is so low.
","DRAM is a commodity part that is commonly found in computer systems. As such, Hydra is widely applicable to mitigating RH security vulnerability across computer systems and consumer electronic devices, such as smart phones, digital TVs, set-top and gaming boxes, digital still and video cameras, hard disk drives, printers, storage and networking equipment, automotive, appliances, and many others.¬†","Hardware,Networks,Software",Moinuddin Qureshi,11/16/2022,"Patent application has been filed

Electrolyte monitoring is critical for care of infants in the intensive care unit to prevent deterioration of the infant‚Äôs condition. While regular blood draws can provide measurements of infant electrolytes, they only offer a view of ion concentrations at one point in time and are painful and potentially damaging to vulnerable blood vessels since they are not yet fully developed in infants. Current wearable monitoring devices are rigid and bulky and do not support natural saliva collection, making them ineffective for real-time, continuous monitoring of salivary electrolytes.

8956,Simulated Synovial Fluid Offers Potential for Effective Treatment of Knee Osteoarthritis,"Knee Osteoarthritis Difficult to Treat Despite High Prevalence
Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common degenerative joint diseases, yet there are limited effective treatment options because the variety of risk factors (e.g., injury, obesity, and genetics) make the severity and progression of the disease difficult to predict. While cell therapies offer non-surgical alternatives for knee OA, outcomes depend on the patient-specific knee OA environment. Cellular responses can be attributed to the components of synovial fluid (SF), which are highly variable among OA patients, adding to the complexity of understanding and treating OA. Therefore, a better understanding of how cell therapies respond to knee OA SF is needed.¬†¬†
","
OA-simulated SF (simSF) provides the opportunity to evaluate how different cell therapies respond to an OA-like environment and potentially advance effective treatment for knee OA. By characterizing OA patient-derived SF (pdSF) and developing OA-targeted potency assays, researchers evaluated cell therapies and developed a simSF that can be used in preclinical studies without the variabilities of using pdSF. With a high fidelity in recreating the OA environment, the simSF bypasses the need for pdSF and yields reproducible predictive outcomes for investigating areas of OA biology and improving knee OA treatment.¬†

	High fidelity in replicating OA environment: Researchers performed extensive testing to determine the most representative prototype for an OA-simulated SF using biological assays, yielding a simSF that is comparable to pdSF.¬†
	Less variability: The simSF offers a means of obtaining functional outcomes in preclinical studies without the variabilities of using pdSF.

8988,"Novel Nanocarriers Strengthen Therapeutic Delivery, Improves Efficacy","Overcoming limited durability and variant response in vaccine development and delivery 
Covid-19 vaccines were successfully developed rapidly to respond to the global pandemic. Yet, researchers have identified limitations with the existing Covid-19 vaccines including but not limited to durability and variant response. These challenges could be answered by improving vaccine delivery. This technology is an innovative development of a cationic and degradable nanoparticle (PAL nanoparticle) made from a chemically synthesized polysaccharide-amino-acid-lipid amphiphilic copolymer. The nanoparticle design enables a dual-loading method and delivery of multiple therapeutic agents, which translates into a more significant effect as the loaded vaccine and its adjuvant can have a synergistic utility. In addition, the likelihood of immunotoxicity is reduced and the agents‚Äô half-life is increased due to the camouflaging effect of the degradable and chemically modified polysaccharide.
","The polysaccharide-amino-acid-lipid degradable nanoparticles have a unique key design, a chemically and functionally synthesized amphiphilic polysaccharide-amino-acid-lipid copolymer from chitosan which is a base polymer and containing these individual chemical functionalities-lipid, amino acid, disulfide linker. This amphiphilic copolymer self-assembles into the nanoparticle system, where outer surface and inner core can be loaded with therapeutic and contrast agents. The outer cationic surface loads the ionically charged molecules like nucleic acids, while the inner core contains hydrophobic drugs.¬†Vaccine delivery benefits when an adjuvant is loaded secondarily as it can protect from rapid catabolism and induce an anti-inflammatory, immune response. The effective degradable polymeric nanoparticles, with the buffering benefit of its amino acids and biodegradability, also position this technology as a promising prospect for gene delivery or contrast reagent transport.","
	Improved efficacy: Loading allows for multiple therapeutic agents (hydrophobic/hydrophilic charged) to be delivered simultaneously, so they work synergistically to provide a more potent therapeutic effectiveness.

Over the last two decades, thin films with a cross-web gradient structure have received growing attention as an area of research due to their improvements in performance and material properties. Used as coatings to modify and/or amplify the functionality of a surface/substrate, polymer thin films have a wide number of applications across industries, including microelectronics, semiconductor devices, wireless communications, integrated circuits, and solar cells. To date, patterned thin films have been fabricated using several techniques. However, these techniques are often material dependent and wasteful and are not scalable or highly efficient.
","
Slot die coating, a well-known scalable manufacturing process, in conjunction with a custom roll-to-roll imaging system allows for the efficient, rapid production of high-quality gradient thin films. Additionally, this innovative manufacturing technique is flexible, as it can use different materials to form the gradient structure. The process works by forcing two fluidic materials into the slot die simultaneously and by manipulating the viscous, diffusion, and inertial forces. The materials intermix with the aim of having a 50% mix along the centerline of any two contiguous stripes. This manufacturing process has been tested (with different coating parameters, substrates, etc.), and the practicality and functionality of the pattern has been demonstrated.¬†

Cybersecurity of networked automation systems is an emerging field of research, with little study of protection for motion control systems.

9034,Vapor Phase Infiltration Produces Solar Cells with Greater Thermal Stability ,"Increasing stability of perovskite solar cells during thermal cycling
To answer the market demand for alternative energy solutions, innovators have worked swiftly to develop perovskite solar cells (PSCs) for commercialization. Yet, one significant barrier remains: stability. The PSCs‚Äô instability, which critically diminishes its product lifetime, can be caused by breakdowns within its organic charge transport layers. The crystallization of the layers‚Äô performance-enhancing oxidized hole-transporting materials, such as spiro-OMeTAD molecules, in the hole transport layer (HTL) is one of the ways the product undermines itself while operational. Although the perovskite layer can endure temperatures as high as 120 ¬∞C, the spiro-OMeTAD layer may start crystallizing after multiple heating cycles at only 70 ¬∞C.
","Vapor Phase Infiltration (VPI) can yield superior thermal stability in PSCs by reducing the cracks and delamination of HTL caused by crystallization at low temperatures. This method effectively infiltrates spiro-OMeTAD with titanium oxide/hydroxide (TiOx) clusters and transforms the layers into a hybrid organic-inorganic material. The converted material limits the crystallization of spiro-OMeTAD that occurs while PSCs are operational. As a result, the main cause of degradation in PSCs is removed.¬†VPI-manufactured PSCs have demonstrated double the power conversion efficiency of basic PSCs upon testing over several hours at 75 ¬∞C. With advanced PSCs able to take on greater operational stress with less degradation, the overall product lifespan is increased for a relatively low cost and primes this product for commercialization success.","

Despite their commercial and technological significance, existing BPMs suffer from poor water transport and rapid deterioration and fail to meet market demand. Not only is there a need for improved BPMs but also for improved methods for preparation, as the large-scale manufacturing of BPMs can be challenging.¬†

Membrane manufacturing can be scaled to industrial levels by using co-extrusion processing or roll-to-roll methods.

9048,Eco-Method Mordant that Improves Natural Dye Adhesion to Synthetic Fabrics,"Existing industrial dye techniques produce significant waste 
Industrial textile manufacturing currently requires extensive chemical waste for the dyeing of synthetic fabrics like polyester. The wastewater from these processes requires extensive treatment to remove the synthetic chemicals before becoming acceptable for release. Textile manufacturers are seeking new methods to provide optimal color with less environmental impact.
","
Vapor Phase Infiltration (VPI) infuses polymers, including fabric fibers, with small amounts of inorganic materials. These infused inorganic species can act as mordants for more effectively binding dyes, including naturally produced dyes that are fully water soluble and benign to the environment. Resultant fabrics have similar handleability but can be vibrantly dyed, which in initial evaluations is not overly susceptible to loss upon washing.¬† Furthermore, VPI does not depend on the same extreme energy demands to produce high heat settings or wastewater management as the existing industry standards require.
 ","
	Eco-friendly: Removing the need for water-polluting chemical carriers that existing polyester dyeing methods require decreases the risk of synthetic pollutants in waterways.
	Energy and cost saving: VPI does not require the excessive heat production as current dyeing processes, thus manufacturing energy costs are reduced.
	Stronger dye adhesion: Infusing polyester material with inorganics provides a strong base for dye adhesion that can be increased by controlling VPI process parameters.
	Improved quality: Utilizing the VPI method can strengthen the dyability of polyester without losing the fabric‚Äôs flexibility and wash-fastness.
	Wide applicability: Increased dye adhesion because of VPI has been observed in materials beyond polyester, including Kevlar and polyacrylonitrile (PAN).

9055,"Quantitative, Performance-Driven Framework for Optimal Desalination Architectures and Energy Subsystems","Desalination systems need to become cheaper, more water efficient, and more environmentally friendly
As growing global water demand impacts uncertain water supplies, clean and efficient desalination systems are needed to provide resiliency to vulnerable populations. While much research has been done to improve desalination technologies, incorporating the complete desalination architecture, which includes the energy subsystems, has not been done. Inefficiencies that exist independently within the desalting systems and the energy subsystems are often compounded when the two systems are integrated.¬†

The expansive design space of desalination architectures needs a systematic framework to promote optimal system selection based on quantitative multi-attribute performance.
","This innovative new framework integrates desalination and energy subsystem design within a single modeling environment. This platform enables better decision making by simultaneously incorporating multiple attributes of both systems for the selection of the most optimized complete desalination architecture.¬†Rather than relying on the typical cost-dominant selection criteria, the framework enables planners to quantify the trade-offs of multiple components in order to identify new, exceptionally competitive designs across all performance attributes. With a focus on renewable energy source (RES) subsystems, complete desalination architectures can be identified that are cheaper, cleaner, and more water efficient than their conventional counterparts. For example, dramatic improvements to greenhouse gas emissions and water efficiency have been demonstrated by identifying system selections that may be purchased at modest price increases over lower cost alternatives.¬†¬†This framework is comprehensive, transparent, reproducible, and is the first of its kind for seawater desalination architectures.","
	Comprehensive: Incorporate and simultaneously compare attributes of multiple types of both desalting systems and energy subsystems.¬†
	Lower cost: Assess parameters that impact overall cost to discover complete architectures that would not have been discoverable using traditional methods.
	Environmentally friendly: Focus on renewable energy subsystems such as solar, wind, geothermal, hydroelectric, and others to create complete desalination architectures that are cleaner and more water efficient than their conventional counterparts.¬†
	Improved performance: Optimize desalting and energy subsystem evaluation to produce unprecedented designs that outperform those identified using traditional efforts.

"7102, 6941",Using Capillary Foams to Recover Spilled Oil,"A method for recovering off-shore oil spills that allows the subsequent recovery of the oil
Inventors at Georgia Tech have identified a method that utilizes surfactant-free, oil-tolerant capillary foams consisting of a combination of colloidal particles, oil, water and gas. This method allows the recovery of off-shore oil spills that allows the subsequent recovery of the oil. A collection device allows the infusion of air and the addition of colloidal particles.¬† As the oil and water is processed through the device, a capillary foam gel is formed. The foam cells are stabilized synergistically by oil and (readily available, inexpensive) solid particles of appropriate wettability, without the need for any surfactants. Networks of oil-bridged solid particles inside the aqueous lamella of capillary foams confer upon the foam a tunable viscosity.

Microfluidic CODES is a novel system of orthogonal microfluidic channel detection that leverages code division multiple access (CDMA), a spread-spectrum telecommunication technique also used by cellular networks to distinguish user signals. In CDMA, signals are transmitted simultaneously and within the same frequency band, while multiplexing is achieved by modulating the information in each channel with a unique digital spreading code. This code helps track the number of cells that have passed through the channel as well as the distinctive properties of each cell, for example, allowing the detection of abnormal and potentially cancerous cells.

*This technology has been exclusively licensed*

Georgia Tech inventors have invented materials and processes for the creation of catalyzed de-polymerization of polymers, including the amplification of the catalyst. In catalyst amplification, small molecules within the polymer body of a device will create additional catalyst molecules upon contact with an initial photo-catalyst at a single trigger source. This allows for generation and amplification of acid catalysts in non-photosensitive regions, and thus increasing the rate of polymer decomposition while substantially reducing residue. Low ceiling temperature polymers are used so that they readily depolymerize when catalyzed. Cross-linking copolymers of phthalaldehyde (PHA) with other aldehydes improves the mechanical properties of the material. The cross-linking can be achieved by a number of mechanisms including free radical reactions of unsaturated carbon bonds. The researchers incorporated unsaturated aldehyde monomers into the polymer along with a free-radical generator additive. This crosslinking leads to increase in molecular weight of the polymer and opens up the possibility of addition of other polymers and other functional groups to obtain desired chemical properties. For packaging methods, potential options include a trigger, such as light or heat, to perform slow evaporation (over a few days or weeks) or fast evaporation over a few minutes.

"7957, 7958",Internet of Space Things,"Space-based cyber-physical system integrates CubeSats with reconfigurable multiband transceiver and antenna 
Innovators at Georgia Tech propose an Internet of Space Things (IoST), a cyber-physical system that integrates on-the-ground data and satellite information to enable a wide range of applications. The space-based network leverages software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) to control and manage a system of miniaturized satellites (CubeSats) and ground-based sensing devices. Deployed in the exosphere, an ad hoc network of CubeSats plays a central role in the system, serving not only as the network infrastructure but also as passive and active sensors.

A novel network architecture provides fine-grained control over the system hardware, improving resource utilization and simplifying management. The system enables programmable control over the physical, link, and network layers of the CubeSats and the sensing devices on the ground. Security is built into the IoST architecture as well as delivered as a service to protect the availability, integrity, and privacy of all connected resources and information.

A key enabling feature is a reconfigurable multiband transceiver and antenna array that increases throughput of satellite communication networks and enhances the spectrum usage efficiency in both ground-satellite and satellite-satellite links.

","Innovators at Georgia Tech propose an Internet of Space Things (IoST), a cyber-physical system that integrates on-the-ground data and satellite information to enable a wide range of applications. The space-based network leverages software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) to control and manage a system of miniaturized satellites (CubeSats) and ground-based sensing devices. Deployed in the exosphere, an ad hoc network of CubeSats plays a central role in the system, serving not only as the network infrastructure but also as passive and active sensors.A novel network architecture provides fine-grained control over the system hardware, improving resource utilization and simplifying management. The system enables programmable control over the physical, link, and network layers of the CubeSats and the sensing devices on the ground. Security is built into the IoST architecture as well as delivered as a service to protect the availability, integrity, and privacy of all connected resources and information.A key enabling feature is a reconfigurable multiband transceiver and antenna array that increases throughput of satellite communication networks and enhances the spectrum usage efficiency in both ground-satellite and satellite-satellite links.

"8080, 8167",Zeolite Membrane Sieves Fabricated on Low-Cost Alumina Hollow Fiber Substrates,"For gas separation in energy production technologies
Innovators at Georgia Tech have developed novel methods for fabricating low-cost zeolite membranes used in molecular separation techniques. Both methods offer a path forward for utilizing zeolite sieves to accelerate scale-up and applications of thin, selective membranes for separating gases and other molecules for energy production, greenhouse gas mitigation, and other applications.

One method fabricates high-silica zeolite membranes directly on low-cost alumina hollow fiber substrates. This one-step process does not require a separate seeding operation or a liquid-phase hydrothermal growth. The use of concentrated precursor gels leads to the generation of highly permeable and selective membranes that exhibit efficient separations.

A second method also fabricates zeolite membranes on alumina hollow fiber substrates but begins with 2D zeolite nanosheets rather than precursor gel. The nanosheets are first coated on the hollow fiber substrates via vacuum filtration and then transformed into molecular sieving membranes.

Both methods allow scalable zeolite membrane fabrication on hollow fibers and also eliminate the need for expensive, specially engineered substrate materials.

The membranes resulting from these methods perform efficient molecular separations. Examples include the removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) from methane, nitrogen, and hydrocarbons in both dry and humid conditions; separation of butane isomers; and removal of higher hydrocarbons (natural gas liquids or NGLs) from methane.

"8207, 8208",Improve the Reliability of Quantum Computers by Mitigating Measurements Errors,"Increases measurement accuracy by 2‚Äì3x via exploitation of state-dependent bias and orchestrating dissimilar mistakes


Two new methods developed by researchers at Georgia Tech to address measurement errors in quantum computers are resulting in a threefold improvement in measurement reliability. Quantum computers are known to be susceptible to errors, particularly measurement operations, and do not currently have the capacity to perform error correction.

Measurement errors have significant bias depending on the state being measured, with some states significantly more error-prone than other states. Therefore, the researchers first developed an ‚ÄúInvert and Measure‚Äù method that exploits the bias in measurement errors by performing an inversion before measurement if the state being measured is likely an error-prone state. Because it is not usually known if the system is in a weak state or strong state, Georgia Tech researchers developed two approaches.

First, a Static Invert-and-Measure (SIM) approach executes two instances of the program‚Äîone with standard measurements and the other with inverted measurements‚Äîand then combines the results. A second approach, Adaptive Invert and Measure (AIM), tailors the inversion profile to suit the machine characteristics and maps the likely solutions to be read in the strong state that is specific to the machine.

The second method mitigates correlated errors seen in quantum computers to reduce incorrect output during measurement. Rather than using a single mapping for all trials, this method, called the Ensemble of Diverse Mapping (EDM), splits the trials into groups and applies a diverse mapping to each group. A Weighted Ensemble of Diverse Mappings approach improves reliability further by placing different weights to the output produced by each mapping.

"8284, 8571",Next-Generation Flow Battery for Large-Scale Energy Storage at One-Tenth the Cost,"Dramatically lowers fabrication costs while achieving higher power density
This novel next-generation zinc-halogen aqueous flow battery uses a hollow fiber-based geometry that enables ultra-high power density while eliminating the need for bipolar plates. Designed by researchers at Georgia Tech, the tubular geometry of the ion-exchange membrane serves as the flow distributor and enhances the rate of ion transfer. The design eliminates extra battery parts to decrease cost while increasing the membrane surface area to increase power density.

The Georgia Tech researchers also created an in operando visualization platform, which allowed them to visualize the in situ dynamics at the surface of the bromine (Br) cathode in the zinc-bromine (Zn-Br) battery. They determined that N-methyl N-ethyl pyrrolidinium bromide (MEPBr) complexes with Br2 to form a second phase, which decreases its solubility. The resulting electrolyte and membrane uses zinc iodide (ZnI2), which has high energy density, high power density, and fast kinetics.

This in operando visualization platform is easy to set up and can be adapted to analyze other electrochemical systems that are sensitive to vacuum, electron beam, or X-ray, such as lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries.
","This novel next-generation zinc-halogen aqueous flow battery uses a hollow fiber-based geometry that enables ultra-high power density while eliminating the need for bipolar plates. Designed by researchers at Georgia Tech, the tubular geometry of the ion-exchange membrane serves as the flow distributor and enhances the rate of ion transfer. The design eliminates extra battery parts to decrease cost while increasing the membrane surface area to increase power density.The Georgia Tech researchers also created an in operando visualization platform, which allowed them to visualize the in situ dynamics at the surface of the bromine (Br) cathode in the zinc-bromine (Zn-Br) battery. They determined that N-methyl N-ethyl pyrrolidinium bromide (MEPBr) complexes with Br2 to form a second phase, which decreases its solubility. The resulting electrolyte and membrane uses zinc iodide (ZnI2), which has high energy density, high power density, and fast kinetics.This in operando visualization platform is easy to set up and can be adapted to analyze other electrochemical systems that are sensitive to vacuum, electron beam, or X-ray, such as lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries.","
Higher power density: This design has achieved ultra-high power densities of 630 W/Ldevice (charge) and 170 W/Ldevice (discharge), compared to existing flow battery designs that achieve only 500 W/Ldevice (charge) and 90 W/Ldevice (discharge).
Ultra-high current density: The design has achieved current densities of >300 mA/cm3 per device.
Dramatically lower cost: The elimination of parts reduces fabrication costs by 90%. Cost is ~$330 rather than ~$4,400.
Scalable: The universal tubular design is highly modular and can be easily scaled up.
Versatile: The design can be applied to various common redox couples such as zinc, vanadium, and anthraquinone-based flow batteries.
Flexible: The high design flexibility allows the flow battery to be directly used for in operando analysis.

This innovation enables the formation of one-dimensional zeolite nanotubes, or single-walled nanotubes consisting of a microporous zeolitic wall enclosing one central mesoporous channel. It derives the nanotubes from aluminosilicate material composed of hollow tubes (approximately 5 nanometers in diameter) with a porous wall that has a zeolite structure.

"8462, 8634",Capillary Flow Control in Lateral Flow Assays (LFAs) via Delaminating Timers,"Advancing the state-of-the-art in LFAs and point-of-care diagnostics
Lateral flow assays (LFAs), or rapid tests, such as common pregnancy or drug tests, typically attempt to identify the presence of a substance via a one-time chemical reaction using a paper-based assay, a liquid (e.g., blood, urine, saliva, etc.), and a reagent. However, more complex diagnostic testing, such as COVID-19 detection, can require multi-step, multi-reagent chemical reactions with specific timings. Georgia Tech researchers have developed a technique to control capillary flow on paper-based LFA substrates that leverages a gradual process, thereby allowing for multiplex molecular detection. This technique has led to the development of low-cost, point-of-care (POC) toolkits for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A and B viruses, as well as improved pregnancy testing.

Researchers were able to create ‚Äútimers‚Äù by imprinting roadblocks on the flow path with water-insoluble material and utilizing the gradual formation of a void between a wetted paper and a sheath polymer tape (i.e., delamination). Timers are drawn on paper at strategic nodes to hold the capillary flow for a desired period of time, hence multiple liquids can be introduced into the reaction following a programmed sequence. Furthermore, by marking the flow boundaries with a material that remains permanently adhered to the sheath tape, researchers were able to imprint on paper complete LFAs programmed to execute multi-step chemical reactions in an optimized manner. Using this technique, Georgia Tech developed 1) an LFA with built-in signal amplification to detect human chorionic gonadotropin (i.e., a pregnancy test) with an order of magnitude higher sensitivity than the conventional assay and 2) a device to extract and purify DNA from blood, saliva, and urine samples without relying on laboratory instruments for post-processing.

These characteristics make LFAs the predominant diagnostic format for POC applications. The addition of delaminating timers has the potential to greatly increase the diagnostic capabilities of LFAs. This technology also includes a mathematical model to guide the design of various flow sequences and timings.

ASSURED: LFAs readily satisfy the majority of the ASSURED (affordable, sensitive, specific, user-friendly, rapid and robust, equipment-free, and deliverable to end-users) criteria reported by the World Health Organization to establish capabilities of POC devices.
Agile: The addition of timers to LFAs provides an opportunity to develop more complex multi-step testing, as well as additional benefits such as built-in signal amplification and POC DNA extraction and purification.
Automated: The ability to sequentially deliver different reagents into a reaction via programmable timers imprinted on paper makes it possible to automate multi-step assays that otherwise could only be performed in laboratories or with manual intervention.
Advanced: The capabilities provided by this technology can make it possible to develop LFAs that can rival ELISA- or PCR-based assays for sensitive and specific detection of pathogenic targets such as Zika virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus, or diseases like malaria.¬†

"8810, 8666, 8786",p-type Be-Doped AlN Films and Layered Films ,"Leveraging the advantages of AIN for ultra-wide bandgap semiconductors as transistors
This technology enables the production and use of p-type beryllium-doped AlN (AlN:Be) films as key components in ultra-wide bandgap semiconductors for the first time. These films can be used in high-power and high-temperature diodes and transistors. Georgia Tech researchers use a unique metal modulated epitaxy (MME) method, a technique performed with widely available, commercial molecular beam epitaxy reactors, to grow the films, overcoming the safety concerns of beryllium-doping using traditional MOCVD methods and enabling break through substantial p-type conduction not observed prior to this work. Two technologies extend this ability to create materials for junction barrier Schottky (JBS) diodes and Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs).

In the first extension of the innovation, the MME method is used to construct a JBS diode, which is an advanced structure to achieve high breakdown voltage with good forward voltage characteristics. Using MME, p-ALN:Be/i-GaN:Be/n-GaN:Ge structures were grown. The lattice mismatch between AlN and GaN results in cracked films. The degree of cracking can be exploited to create a new form of JBS diode that incorporates a p-type AlN layer grown beyond the crack formation thickness on top of the unintentionally doped (UID) layer. Because the cracks extend down to the UID layer, Schottky metals deposited on the surface will cover the p-type AlN and contact the UID layer forming cyclic Schottky diodes in the crack gaps separated by p-AlN/ UID/ n-type gallium nitride (GaN) diodes adjacent to the Schottky diodes. This is a simpler fabrication method and results in higher breakdown performance.

In the second extension of the innovation, a high breakdown, high-power SBD was achieved using the MME method to grow AlN:Be in layers along with additional levels of doping of AIN. This new Schottky diode fulfills the potential of Be-doped AIN for the creation of ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) semiconductors for high-power, high-frequency devices capable of operation in extreme heat and radiation environments.

"9033, 9039",Reducing Traffic Congestion and Achieving Driver Anticipation in Autonomous Vehicles,"Current ACC systems struggle to achieve anticipative driving 
Current adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems, used in conventional and self-driving vehicles, have shown little ability to perform ‚Äúanticipative driving‚Äù, which human drivers employ regularly when they see and react to multiple downstream vehicles. Anticipative driving benefits safety by detecting downstream incidents earlier and reducing the response time required, while also reducing traffic oscillations behind the lead vehicle (resulting in less traffic congestion).

Two significant issues with current ACC systems are that 1) they tend to focus primarily on the car directly ahead of the ACC system, and 2) they rely on prediction of the leader‚Äôs future movements via machine learning approaches. While manufacturers are adding sensors to detect vehicles and objects beyond the immediate vicinity of the ACC system, machine learning prediction is still an ongoing challenge and requires extra processing power for implementation. The result is that the limited predictive capabilities of these systems can often make traffic worse by amplifying traffic oscillations and not foreseeing potential issues.
","This technology‚Äôs simple approach to improving ACC‚Äôs impact on traffic congestion supplants machine-learning-based prediction by focusing on history trajectories. The invention achieves congestion-friendly driving by recording the history trajectory of the leader and then shifting it into the future horizon to obtain a reference trajectory for the subject vehicle (the ‚Äúego‚Äù vehicle) known as the Newell trajectory. This Newell trajectory is used as a reference to plan a future ego trajectory that does not amplify the speed oscillations from the leader.The invention further achieves anticipative driving by simply incorporating more history trajectories from one to multiple downstream vehicles, as shown in Figure 1. This additional design allows ACC to have a longer reference trajectory for planning, which in turn helps ACC to react to more downstream vehicles.¬†History trajectories have been implemented using a 2019 demonstration vehicle, and the additional design for anticipative driving has also been implemented in simulations using the commercially available code base, which suggests that this invention is compatible with current commercial car models with ACC and would continue to enhance performance as more sensors are added to future ACC systems.","
	Ease of Implementation: Leverages existing sensing technologies to reduce congestion through ACC software changes
	Reduced Processing: Using history trajectories to achieve anticipative driving and reduce congestion requires significantly less processing power than machine learning
	Future Friendly: As automated driving systems advance by adding additional sensors, this data can be added via software to produce more history trajectory data, which can further improve driver anticipation capabilities

9034,Vapor Phase Infiltration Produces Solar Cells with Greater Thermal Stability ,"Increasing stability of perovskite solar cells during thermal cycling
To answer the market demand for alternative energy solutions, innovators have worked swiftly to develop perovskite solar cells (PSCs) for commercialization. Yet, one significant barrier remains: stability. The PSCs‚Äô instability, which critically diminishes its product lifetime, can be caused by breakdowns within its organic charge transport layers. The crystallization of the layers‚Äô performance-enhancing oxidized hole-transporting materials, such as spiro-OMeTAD molecules, in the hole transport layer (HTL) is one of the ways the product undermines itself while operational. Although the perovskite layer can endure temperatures as high as 120 ¬∞C, the spiro-OMeTAD layer may start crystallizing after multiple heating cycles at only 70 ¬∞C.
","Vapor Phase Infiltration (VPI) can yield superior thermal stability in PSCs by reducing the cracks and delamination of HTL caused by crystallization at low temperatures. This method effectively infiltrates spiro-OMeTAD with titanium oxide/hydroxide (TiOx) clusters and transforms the layers into a hybrid organic-inorganic material. The converted material limits the crystallization of spiro-OMeTAD that occurs while PSCs are operational. As a result, the main cause of degradation in PSCs is removed.¬†VPI-manufactured PSCs have demonstrated double the power conversion efficiency of basic PSCs upon testing over several hours at 75 ¬∞C. With advanced PSCs able to take on greater operational stress with less degradation, the overall product lifespan is increased for a relatively low cost and primes this product for commercialization success.","
	Stability: Decreasing spiro-OMeTAD crystallization improves the thermal stability of hole transport layers within PSCs¬†

Industrial textile manufacturing currently requires extensive chemical waste for the dyeing of synthetic fabrics like polyester. The wastewater from these processes requires extensive treatment to remove the synthetic chemicals before becoming acceptable for release. Textile manufacturers are seeking new methods to provide optimal color with less environmental impact.
","Vapor Phase Infiltration (VPI) infuses polymers, including fabric fibers, with small amounts of inorganic materials. These infused inorganic species can act as mordants for more effectively binding dyes, including naturally produced dyes that are fully water soluble and benign to the environment. Resultant fabrics have similar handleability but can be vibrantly dyed, which in initial evaluations is not overly susceptible to loss upon washing.¬† Furthermore, VPI does not depend on the same extreme energy demands to produce high heat settings or wastewater management as the existing industry standards require.","
	Eco-friendly: Removing the need for water-polluting chemical carriers that existing polyester dyeing methods require decreases the risk of synthetic pollutants in waterways.
	Energy and cost saving: VPI does not require the excessive heat production as current dyeing processes, thus manufacturing energy costs are reduced.
	Stronger dye adhesion: Infusing polyester material with inorganics provides a strong base for dye adhesion that can be increased by controlling VPI process parameters.
	Improved quality: Utilizing the VPI method can strengthen the dyability of polyester without losing the fabric‚Äôs flexibility and wash-fastness.
	Wide applicability: Increased dye adhesion because of VPI has been observed in materials beyond polyester, including Kevlar and polyacrylonitrile (PAN).

8537,"Hybrid Molecular Catalysts: A New Blueprint for Catalyst Design, Preparation, and Testing ","Homogeneous molecular catalysts cannot be easily scaled up due to complex product separation and catalyst recovery
Homogeneous molecular catalysts enable reaction specificity, which is critical in drug manufacturing and other specialty chemicals. However, these types of catalysts are difficult to scale up due to complexities in final product separation and catalyst recovery. Heterogenizing these molecular catalysts, by attachment to a solid metal-oxide support, could transform the practical utility of molecular catalysts, simplifying catalyst separation and recovery to a filtering and washing process. Previous strategies to heterogenize molecular catalysts have suffered from reduced catalytic activity and leaching (loss) of catalyst, especially in environmentally friendly solvents like water.
","This approach to heterogenize molecular catalysts follows two steps: first attaching the catalyst to a metal oxide support and then encapsulating it with metal oxide via atomic layer deposition (ALD) to prevent molecular detachment from the surface. This versatile method can be used to attach nearly any type of catalyst molecule to an inorganic support because it does not require any specific chemistry. This new hybrid molecular catalyst exhibits unique reactivity compared to a variety of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalyst analogs.Using ALD to create hybrid catalysts via immobilization of molecular catalysts (without concern for their homogeneous reactivity) opens up a new approach and chemical space for catalyst discovery. This new paradigm can improve the attachment and stability of molecular catalysts on solid metal oxide supports, making the catalysts easily separable from reaction solutions and recyclable for repeated use.¬†","
	Improved Reactivity: Attachment of molecular catalysts to solid supports can lead to new reactivity not seen under homogeneous conditions
	Reusable: At an optimal ALD layer thickness, the molecular catalyst remains highly active while still being resistant to surface detachment and subsequent deactivation
	Cost-effective: Catalyst separation and recovery is achieved via a simple filtering and washing process rather than energy- and time-intensive distillation or re-crystallization processes
	Scalable: In addition to the simple filter-and-wash process mentioned above, encapsulation requires only about 10 reaction cycles, making this process technologically and economically viable for large-scale manufacturing

Random access memory (RAM) is a key component that impacts computers‚Äô performance. RAM provides applications with a place to store and access data on a real-time basis. Dynamic RAM (DRAM) is a common type of RAM currently used in desktops and laptops. Despite years of research, DRAM systems are increasingly plagued by Row-Hammer (RH) security vulnerability. Current RH solutions that rely on static RAM (SRAM) incur impractical storage overheads that are not appealing for commercial adoption. Other solutions that store per-row metadata in the RAM space cause significant slowdown in performance. As such, there is a need for a viable solution to mitigate RH, as DRAM is a commodity part widely used in all computer systems.
","Hydra, a hybrid tracker for RH mitigation, combines the best of both SRAM and DRAM to enable low-cost RH mitigation at ultra-low thresholds. Hydra is composed of two structures: (1) an SRAM-based structure that tracks aggregated counts of a group of rows and (2) a per-row tracker stored in the DRAM array that is only used for the small number of rows that exceed the tracking capability of the SRAM-based structure. Using the per-row tracker in this way limits performance overheads. Hydra enables robust RH mitigation while incurring an SRAM overhead of only 28 KB per-rank and an average slowdown of only 0.7%.¬†","
	Complete solution: Hydra combines the best of SRAM-tracking (low performance overhead) and DRAM-tracking (low SRAM overhead and flexibility of tracking all rows) to produce the only RH mitigation that is effective at ultra-low thresholds.¬†

7841,Synthetic Hydrogel for Satellite Cell Delivery in Dystrophic Skeletal Muscle ,"Current clinical interventions do not regenerate muscle tissue due to aging, trauma, and dystrophic disease 
Muscle satellite cells (MuSC) play a central role in muscle regeneration, but their quantity and function decline through physical trauma, aging, and disease, translating to impaired regenerative potential of muscle and may lead to long-term disabilities and reduced quality of life. Current interventions for muscle trauma ‚Äì primarily muscle flap transfer and surgical suture ‚Äì do not completely regenerate damaged muscle. Clinical strategies to address injured muscle in aging or disease are needed. Interventions targeting the diaphragm are of particularly critical importance, as damage to the diaphragm can lead to breathing difficulties and potentially death. This is the case with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), and other dystrophic disease. Respiratory care, such as mechanically assisted ventilation, remains palliative. Targeting the diaphragm for MuSC/protein delivery is a promising therapeutic avenue but has been challenging due to the thin dimension of the muscle and its deep-seated anatomic location.¬†
","These engineered hydrogels comprised of synthetic polymers and peptides are designed to enable successful MuSC transplantation to the diaphragm or other dystrophic skeletal muscle tissue, thereby restoring dystrophin ‚Äì a protein absent in DMD and critical to strengthening and repairing muscle fibers. The hydrogels can be loaded with myogenic agents such as MuSCs and/or pro-myogenic factors to form a bioadhesive matrix with optimal mechanical, cell-adhesive, and protease-degradable properties that support MuSC cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. The innovation also includes a cell delivery strategy for treating muscle trauma/deterioration by robust engraftment in cases where intramuscular injections may not be applicable. With positive results shown in mouse studies, the hydrogel-based matrix offers a promising treatment for muscle trauma in elderly and dystrophic patients and represents the first work of its kind to enable targeted cell/protein delivery to the diaphragmatic muscle.","
	Robust: Includes a biomaterial-mediated cell delivery strategy resulting in strong engraftment that provides an option for treating muscle trauma where injections are contraindicated

	Flexible: Enables delivery of a wide range of therapeutics, including cells, proteins, and small molecule drugs
	Non-sutured delivery: Uses thiol-maleimide chemistry to covalently adhere cells to the diaphragm (or other muscle) surface without puncturing the muscle, unlike prior (unproven) attempts that required surgically stitching a decellularized scaffold to the diaphragm
	Tested: Demonstrated significantly improved in vivo cell survival, proliferation, and engraftment in non-irradiated and immunocompetent muscles of aged and dystrophic mice compared with collagen gels and cells-only controls
	Adaptable: Provides the opportunity to treat previously unaddressed diaphragmatic deterioration and resulting respiratory failure and may serve as an important foundation for further bioengineering research and ultimately patient care

Soft tissue pathologies are currently treated with a wide range of materials, however, most of these lack optimal mechanical profiles, are not biodegradable, and/or do not exhibit shape memory behavior to either treat soft tissue pathologies or be used via minimally invasive surgical (MIS) treatment methods. In the simplest terms, existing technologies tend to be either too ‚Äúhard‚Äù (e.g., thermoplastic polymers) or too ‚Äúsoft‚Äù (e.g., hydrogels), with each extreme presenting its own set of problems: too hard can lead to tissue erosion or the eventual migration of the device leading to organ or vessel obstruction, while too soft can lead to implant migration and rapid resorption, which can necessitate repeat procedures.¬†

A major challenge in the treatment of soft tissue pathologies, such as those stemming from acute injury, age-related wear, and disease, is the production of biomaterials that exhibit mechanical properties similar to those of complex soft tissues. Soft tissues display nonlinear elastic and viscoelastic mechanical properties, requiring similar behavior from potential therapeutic biomaterials enabling appropriate tissue repair within and around the pathology. In order to allow for tissue infiltration onto and within the implanted device, these materials should be biodegradable and bioresorbable, ultimately replacing the pathology with healthy tissue and removing the need for a permanent implant.

","Shape memory polymers (SMPs) are a versatile family of materials developed for numerous applications including heat shrinkable tubing, smart textiles, and actuation for soft robotics. SMPs can be leveraged to treat soft tissue pathologies via MIS procedures as materials exhibiting shape memory behavior can fit in a delivery device, and ultimately ‚Äì upon implantation and exposure to body temperature ‚Äì expand to fit the tissue defect. Novel biomaterials developed to solve the challenge of soft tissue treatment via MIS procedures can leverage the rapidly advancing technology of 3D printing to be able to manufacture patient-specific devices.

This technology utilizes a new synthesis reaction combining a previously described (US8236350 also from Hollister) shape-memory, biodegradable, elastomeric material with photocurable chemistries used in several clinically approved applications. The use of these novel photo-crosslinkable polymers [i.e., poly(glycerol dodecanedioate), or PGD] for 3D printing applications and using direct-write nozzle-based printing and resin-based sterolithography (SLA) printing provides not only patient specificity, but also biodegradability and shape memory behavior allowing the printed polymers to fit within MIS access devices. MIS is rapidly expanding across all healthcare disciplines because of reduced costs and improved patient outcomes. In addition to accommodating design and development of patient specific anatomic devices, 3D printing these materials can accelerate development from prototyping to production for a broad range of soft tissue repair applications.","

Biomedical implantations are utilized to restore, replace, or support existing tissue, and in particular for soft tissue repair. Biocompatible devices are used for these implantations in cases ranging from a newborn with a congenital complication to the elderly with endothelial dysfunction. Though minimally invasive techniques are less risky, when introducing a foreign object into the body there is always the possibility of infection or complete rejection, and this must be considered in light of the current antibiotic resistance crisis. Hence, there is a critical need to develop materials that minimize a foreign body reaction and reduce the number repair procedures. For example, patch repair recurrence rate is >50% amongst congenital diaphragmatic hernia patients between 0 years old and 3 years old using the standard of care, Goretex synthetic patch. Each recurrence requiring an additional procedure increases the infection or rejection risk.
","New shape memory polymers offer an improved approach to soft tissue repair because they provide adaptability ‚Äì most important in pediatric patients ‚Äì and can be biodegradable. This technology applies the following innovative physical and chemical modifications to the implants to enable catalyzing repair and regeneration of surrounding tissues for a faster recovery: laser cutting, casting, EDC NHS modification, and porosity. With improved tissue regeneration and cell attachment at a faster pace than existing solutions, the risk of infection or rejection is decreased. Furthermore, the structural (e.g., micropatterns, dimensional patterns) and chemical (e.g., acid and base treatment, solvent casting) adjustments to the polymer reduce recurring procedures for repairs and may prevent advanced clinical antibiotic intervention. Despite the significant modifications, all the methods permit the polymer to maintain its predefined shape. There is cost savings to the healthcare system, manufacturer, and patient while reducing healthcare complications and improving patient outcomes.See also:¬†8655 Biodegradable Shape Memory Polymer for 3D-Printed Tissue and Biomedical Devices","

8729,"Lightweight, Versatile Cryogenic Conductors","Lightweight, highly conductive alkali metals are too chemically reactive for use as electrical wires
With major aerospace companies working on development of electrical aircraft that use cryogenic fuels, the need is growing for cryogenic conductors with superior gravimetric power density. Current commercially available superconducting wires support very high current densities and conduct electric direct current at zero losses. However, they suffer from drawbacks including geometrical constraints, high manufacturing costs, and difficulty being manufactured in long lengths. Copper conductors do not have these drawbacks, but they are heavy. Alkali metals such as lithium offer more conductivity per unit mass compared to copper but have high chemical reactivity.¬†
","A good balance between properties can be found in copper-clad lithium (CuCLi) conductors. Because lithium exhibits improved electrical performance at low temperatures, higher conductivity per unit density values can be achieved, making this invention crucial for applications with high gravimetric power density needs (e.g., aerospace). CuCLi wires are lightweight, versatile, and cost-effective and can be used in cryogenic conditions for aircraft and high-frequency applications.","
	Higher current density per unit mass: Alkali metals such as lithium exhibit good electrical conductivity at low mass density, especially under cryogenic conditions.
	Round wires at long lengths: CuCLi wires have an advantage over superconductors in that they can have a circular cross section and can be made at long lengths, making them suitable for windings in motors, generators, and transformers.
	Complex geometries: Unlike superconductors, CuCLi parts can be made to any geometry, making them suitable for cable accessories such as terminations, clamps, feedthroughs, and connectors.
	Versatile operating conditions: CuCLi conductors can operate over a wider range of temperatures, current densities, and magnetic flux densities than superconductors. While the losses increase with higher temperatures, current densities, and magnetic flux densities, there is no critical point at which they stop working.
	Standard tools: Cladding the lithium core with copper enables the billet to be drawn using standard wire-drawing techniques and tools, while protecting the core from chemically reacting with the environment. It also allows the manufacturing of CuCLi litz wires, which are suitable for high-frequency operation.
	Low cost: Lithium is abundant and inexpensive.

8467,Reducing Intraocular Pressure in Glaucoma Patients Without Drugs or Surgery via a Simple Hydrogel Injection,"Drug-free and surgery-free management of intraocular pressure (IOP) may lower risks and increase patient adherence
Elevated IOP in glaucoma and ocular hypertension patients is traditionally managed with pharmaceuticals or surgery. Drug treatments, such as eye drops or pills, must be taken daily, which is burdensome over the lifetime of the patient and leads to poor compliance. Surgical options, either incisional or laser-based, can be complex and costly, and often lose efficacy with time.¬†

As a new therapeutic approach, hyaluronic acid hydrogel injection to expand the suprachoroidal space (SCS) may allow patients to avoid daily eyedrop delivery or remove the necessity of surgery, even in emergent cases. When neither approach can be avoided, this injection to lower IOP could work as a combination therapy to boost the impact of the required therapeutic or surgical route.
","Hydrogel injections to alleviate elevated IOP would require one simple office visit every 4 - 6 months with fast results, and extended impact. This drug-free approach was shown effective in animal models for 120 days, with an initial drop in IOP measured within hours of treatment. Additionally, the injection is rapid and can be performed as an in-office procedure and does not require the pinpoint accuracy of lasers while limiting the risk of complications that can result with incisions. There are significant cost-savings anticipated for the patient and/or revenue generation for the clinician with a simplified procedure that does not require daily pharmaceutical care or surgical costs. This technology could also be applied in veterinary sciences thus broadening the market potential.","
	Increased patient adherence: Patients do not need to remember to take their eye drops one or more times per day. Further, the treatment provider knows definitively that the therapy has been delivered.¬†
	Safe: With a singular hydrogel injection via a microneedle, the risk of tissue damage caused by a surgical incision or laser application is eliminated.
	Simpler: Simplifying the treatment process from standard daily drug intake to a brief office visit only once every 4-6 months is easier for patient compliance.
	Fast: The hydrogel injection does not require pre- or post-operative care unlike surgical standard of care and effective IOP lowering can be measured within hours.¬†
	Long-lasting: Expansion of the SCS with measurable IOP reduction for 120 days has been shown in animal studies.

Ocular disorders are increasingly prevalent in the smartphone era as more people use their devices at close range for extended periods. The problem is of particular concern for young users who are exposed to excessive use of smart devices at an early age. Common ocular disorders, including convergence insufficiency (CI) and strabismus, cause debilitating headaches, blurred vision, fatigue, and attention loss. For decades, treatment options have been limited to invasive surgery or clinic-based vision therapy. Current home-based vision therapy often uses outdated techniques and has diminishing success rates over time.

8956,Simulated Synovial Fluid Offers Potential for Effective Treatment of Knee Osteoarthritis,"Knee Osteoarthritis Difficult to Treat Despite High Prevalence
Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common degenerative joint diseases, yet there are limited effective treatment options because the variety of risk factors (e.g., injury, obesity, and genetics) make the severity and progression of the disease difficult to predict. While cell therapies offer non-surgical alternatives for knee OA, outcomes depend on the patient-specific knee OA environment. Cellular responses can be attributed to the components of synovial fluid (SF), which are highly variable among OA patients, adding to the complexity of understanding and treating OA. Therefore, a better understanding of how cell therapies respond to knee OA SF is needed.¬†¬†
","OA-simulated SF (simSF) provides the opportunity to evaluate how different cell therapies respond to an OA-like environment and potentially advance effective treatment for knee OA. By characterizing OA patient-derived SF (pdSF) and developing OA-targeted potency assays, researchers evaluated cell therapies and developed a simSF that can be used in preclinical studies without the variabilities of using pdSF. With a high fidelity in recreating the OA environment, the simSF bypasses the need for pdSF and yields reproducible predictive outcomes for investigating areas of OA biology and improving knee OA treatment.¬†","
	Clearly defined components: OA simSF was developed based on the results from the characterization of OA pdSF, including the relative abundance of proteins (e.g., FGF-2, HGF, G-CSF, MIG, and MCP-1) and other key components that have been reported as potential biomarkers of OA (e.g., chondroitin and keratan sulfates).¬†
	High fidelity in replicating OA environment: Researchers performed extensive testing to determine the most representative prototype for an OA-simulated SF using biological assays, yielding a simSF that is comparable to pdSF.¬†
	Less variability: The simSF offers a means of obtaining functional outcomes in preclinical studies without the variabilities of using pdSF.

8887,‚ÄúSmart‚Äù Feedback-Controlled Bioreactor Platform Enables Consistent High-Yield and High-Quality MSC Products,"Large-scale reproduction of high-quality hCT-MSC clinical cultures needed
Human umbilical cord tissue mesenchymal stromal cells (hCT-MSCs) have been widely evaluated in several clinical trials for treating patients with a variety of medical conditions, including COVID-19. There are, however, significant challenges related to their manufacturing, and biological variabilities remain. A key challenge in cell therapy manufacturing is understanding how the bioreactor environment affects cell proliferation and quality. Additionally, there are no current strategies for implementing automated feedback controls to improve process efficiency and product reproducibility.¬†

Current state-of-the-art bioreactors rely on off-line sampling and manual adjustment of feed rates in their expansion protocols. This fixed recipe for culturing cannot account for variabilities in the expansion process, as is often the case with unique donor cells. Optimizing these large-scale bioreactors is also limited by resources and cost.
","This ‚Äúsmart‚Äù bioreactor platform is a semi-autonomous system that incorporates in-line sensors, modeling, data-driven controllers, and an automated sampling platform.¬†Its feedback-controlled hollow fiber-based bioreactor enables identifying critical quality attributes (CQA) and critical process parameters (CPP) for high-quantity and high-quality hCT-MSCs for ideal cell growth and efficacy. It also provides the controls to maintain these conditions to improve expansion yield and cell viability. Based on large-scale commercial bioreactors, this scaled-down system leverages sensors and state estimation models to inform and control CPPs and maintain a more consistent growth environment for cells that is both scalable and reproducible. The small-scale system reduces costs, labor, time, and perturbations and improves yields of MSC products.The design paves the way for a next-generation bioreactor that permits plug-and-play integration of analytical technologies to shape the biomanufacturing landscape for cell therapies and to potentially enable the wide-spread use of MSCs as a clinical therapy.","

Monitoring of cell culture bioreactors is critical to process control and optimization for multiple applications, including production of monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, recombinant proteins, stem cells, and gene therapy. Because current automated bioreactor sampling systems primarily use lines of tubing to transfer samples to storage locations, they frequently have issues with cross-contamination and loss of media within the tubing lines. Controlling contamination with these systems requires skilled staff trained in thorough cleaning and maintenance of equipment and an effective preventative maintenance program.
","This gantry-style multi-axis actuator uses a syringe pump end effector to extract samples from an in-line rubber septum that is within a tubing-based system, depositing the extracted samples into sealed cryovials for storage. The disposable syringe can be replaced after each sample to eliminate nearly all possibility of cross-contamination and maintain sample integrity.The system comprises a microcontroller and corresponding electronics that control the horizontal actuator, syringe pump, and a vertical actuator. The vertical actuator moves the syringe pump assembly to retrieve a disposable syringe stored in the storage vial. The samples can then be transferred between, for example, a bioreactor recirculation line and sample cryovial. After the transfer, the disposable syringe can be detached from the syringe pump assembly and the process repeated for the next sample. The automated sampling platform can be used with any type of samples and collection.","
	Maintains sample integrity: Automatically changing the syringe between samples will eliminate nearly all possibility of cross-contamination between samples.
	Simplifies sampling: The automated design includes a processor programmed to execute control of the actuator for sampling at specified times and can be integrated with sensors to trigger samples based on specific sensor readings.

9012,Enhanced Cybersecurity for Networked Motion Control Systems with Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption,"Encryption for motion control systems is very limited 
Cybersecurity of networked automation systems is an emerging field of research, with little study of protection for motion control systems. While encryption effectively secures data by encapsulating sensitive information at the communication level, when applied to motion control systems, the increasing multiplicative depth creates overflow (meaning the cipher text can no longer be decrypted back to plain text) and leads to loss of precision and loss of protection.¬†
","Expression rewrite rules for encrypted dynamic control schemes reduce the multiplicative depth of somewhat homomorphic encryption and improve numerical stability, translating to increased cybersecurity. This new approach encrypts motion control algorithms, sensor signals, model parameters, feedback and feedforward gains, and performs necessary computation in the ciphertext space to generate motion commands to servo systems without creating a security hole. Information decryption and control signal calculation can be performed and executed inside the plant, but all sensitive system information outside of the plant is always encrypted.¬†The topological sorting of algorithms based on associative rewrite rules effectively addresses potential overflow issues.","
	Enhanced security: Homomorphic encryption makes it possible to perform calculations on encrypted data, ensuring protection both inside and outside of the plant

8988,"Novel Nanocarriers Strengthen Therapeutic Delivery, Improves Efficacy ","Overcoming limited durability and variant response in vaccine development and delivery 
Covid-19 vaccines were successfully developed rapidly to respond to the global pandemic. Yet, researchers have identified limitations with the existing Covid-19 vaccines including but not limited to durability and variant response. These challenges could be answered by improving vaccine delivery. This technology is an innovative development of a cationic and degradable nanoparticle (PAL nanoparticle) made from a chemically synthesized polysaccharide-amino-acid-lipid amphiphilic copolymer. The nanoparticle design enables a dual-loading method and delivery of multiple therapeutic agents, which translates into a more significant effect as the loaded vaccine and its adjuvant can have a synergistic utility. In addition, the likelihood of immunotoxicity is reduced and the agents‚Äô half-life is increased due to the camouflaging effect of the degradable and chemically modified polysaccharide.
","The polysaccharide-amino-acid-lipid degradable nanoparticles have a unique key design, a chemically and functionally synthesized amphiphilic polysaccharide-amino-acid-lipid copolymer from chitosan which is a base polymer and containing these individual chemical functionalities-lipid, amino acid, disulfide linker. This amphiphilic copolymer self-assembles into the nanoparticle system, where outer surface and inner core can be loaded with therapeutic and contrast agents. The outer cationic surface loads the ionically charged molecules like nucleic acids, while the inner core contains hydrophobic drugs.¬†Vaccine delivery benefits when an adjuvant is loaded secondarily as it can protect from rapid catabolism and induce an anti-inflammatory, immune response. The effective degradable polymeric nanoparticles, with the buffering benefit of its amino acids and biodegradability, also position this technology as a promising prospect for gene delivery or contrast reagent transport.","
	Improved efficacy: Loading allows for multiple therapeutic agents (hydrophobic/hydrophilic charged) to be delivered simultaneously, so they work synergistically to provide a more potent therapeutic effectiveness.

Across all classes of chemical microsensors, high sensitivity, low limit of detection, long-term stability, and high selectivity are desired. Of these properties, selectivity remains the most difficult to improve due to the tradeoff of the reversibility of analyte interaction with the sensing layer. Therefore, methods that enhance selectivity without tailoring the sensing layer chemistry are needed.
","An improved gravimetric chemical sensor is overlayed with an interdigitated electrode (IDE) structure, enabling multivariate sensing using a single polymeric film. The single micromachined multivariate gas sensor with multiple outputs discriminates between multiple VOCs by utilizing variations in the transient response times of the gravimetric and impedimetric responses. Using comparisons of transient response in 2D dispersion in addition to the steady-state response showed enhanced discriminatory ability versus steady-state response alone.This innovation highlights the ability of certain multi-sensors to enhance selectivity not only through use of the steady-state dispersions but also transient response time dispersions at no additional cost to the sensor designer, as only the software needs to be updated, not the sensor itself. This work could pave the way for future work targeting enhanced selectivity mechanisms with drastically improving sensor response times, which is critical for monitoring VOCs in industrial environments and closed operational settings.See complementary capability 8269¬†for the low-cost multi-sensor.","

Manufacturing functional materials for energy harvesting, thermal management, and coatings depends on the resolution of a longstanding issue with designing optical materials: how to engineer a response over multiple spectral bands. Materials for radiative cooling, for example, must strongly scatter visible wavelengths while strongly absorbing mid-infrared (mid-IR) radiation, and ultraviolet (UV) protective coatings must absorb or reflect UV light while remaining transparent in the visible wavelengths. To engineer a response in multiple bands, components that have optical resonances in different spectral regions must be combined; however, this process is typically application-specific and time-consuming.¬†
","Nanowire geode-based materials‚Äîhollow silica microcapsules containing semiconductor nanowires‚Äîprovide a scalable solution with expansive applications. The nanoscale programmable structure of the nanowires allows their optical response to be engineered precisely over multiple spectral bands, from UV through mid-IR. The nanowires are grown in and encapsulated by colloidal silica microcapsules to form ‚Äúmicrogeodes‚Äù that enable bulk and scalable synthesis while protecting the nanowires and ensuring they remain inside. By combining the optical properties of nanowires with the processability of conventional colloidal particles, the microgeodes provide a versatile photonic materials platform for a range of applications, including radiative cooling, UV protection, and spectrally tuned/tunable camouflage.","
	Programmable: The hierarchical structure of the microgeodes allows their optical response to be controlled precisely over multiple spectral bands, from UV through mid-IR.¬†¬†
	Scalable: Microgeodes offer an unprecedented combination of optical programmability and ease of fabrication. Given a target optical response, it is possible to specify a material structure that has the desired response.
	Versatile photonic platform: Microgeodes combine the tunability and versatility of nanowires (i.e., unparalleled control over the frequencies and widths of resonances) with the processability of microspheres (i.e., can be incorporated into flow processes and are easily stabilized).

8904,"Melting Microneedle Patches Extend Drug Delivery Applications, Simplify Manufacturing, and Reduce Costs ","Dissolving microneedle drug delivery applications are limited by drug/biomolecule solubility/instability 
Active pharmaceutical ingredients that have poor aqueous solubility have limited applications for use in existing dissolving microneedle drug delivery technologies. To overcome the poor drug solubility, the current approach is to use organic solvents for microneedle patch casting, which can complicate the manufacturing process with long evaporation steps and destabilization of the bioactive materials. Besides the intrinsic instability of biomolecules, liquid formulations needed for their casting pose an additional risk of degradation. Another limitation is the controlled or extended release of protein antigens, which needs sophisticated microneedle designs or harsh encapsulation conditions that all have a detrimental effect on active ingredients.
","These melting microneedles are made of hydrophobic matrices of waxes that melt once inserted into skin and body temperature is reached. The drug or vaccine within the molten matrix diffuses out into the surrounding interstitial fluid based on its intrinsic aqueous solubility, viscosity of the molten wax, and rate of wax clearance from the skin. This approach can be used with poorly soluble drugs as well as water-soluble drugs that can be dispersed into the molten wax prior to casting. This eliminates the need for organic solvents in the first cast, improving stabilization for the loaded drug or vaccine. It also shortens the manufacturing time, eliminates the need to maintain a cold chain for storage and transportation, and reduces the ultimate cost of the microneedle patch. These safe hydrophobic matrices are inexpensive and enable control of the drug release timing. An expected shorter microneedle patch wear time will be more appealing to users and may result in better compliance and optimal delivery of the loaded drug.","
	Stabilizing: This technology enables poorly soluble as well as water-soluble drugs to be dispersed, eliminating the need for solvents which translates to improved stabilization.
	Faster production: Unlike dissolving microneedles that often take days to dry their aqueous or organic-based formulations, these waxes require no further drying steps since the solidification of the microneedles is instantaneous upon cooling.¬†
	Simplifies handling: Excluding water from the drug/vaccine casting process altogether further improves stability, allowing extended storage time outside the cold chain.
	Reduces costs: Simplified production and handling‚Äîin addition to the use of inexpensive hydrophobic matrices‚Äîreduces costs.¬†
	Safe: Hydrophobic matrices used in the manufacturing of the melting microneedles have a well-documented safety record with many years of usage.¬†
	Controllable delivery: The hydrophobic nature and the wide variety of wax composition enables tailoring of the extended-release profile for drugs, vaccines, or hormones, meeting specific desirable release profiles.
	Shorter wear time: Unlike dissolving microneedle drug delivery that can be delayed because of limited interstitial fluid at the site of microneedle patch application, melting microneedle patch wear time can be much shorter as it only depends on melting, which can be very fast. This feature will be more appealing to users and could translate to better compliance and assured delivery of the entire loaded dose per patch.¬†
	Stronger immune response: Extended delivery of an inactivated antigen enabled through loading into melting microneedles has the potential to present antigen over a prolonged time period and generate a stronger immune response to the same dose.

9063,"Improved Electrically Driven Temperature Swing Adsorption (ETSA) System for Faster, More Productive Direct Air Capture of Carbon Dioxide","Direct capture of CO2 from air needs to be faster, simpler, and more productive
Direct air capture (DAC) technologies, which extract CO2 directly from the air, are an important component of global strategies to mitigate climate change. Most systems use temperature swing adsorption (TSA) cycles with vacuum-assisted or steam-driven desorption systems, which cause complications with auxiliary equipment and the need for water management before and after the adsorbents are exposed to steam.¬†

Electrically driven temperature swing adsorption (ETSA) systems improve energy efficiency and may enable smaller DAC systems. Renewable activated carbon materials in a DAC system that employs Joule heating (a process that converts electrical current into thermal energy) have the potential to reduce CO2 emissions. However, CO2 is only weakly adsorbed in this process, and the activated carbon materials do not have a high enough capacity to effectively capture CO2, especially in dilute CO2 conditions such as those found in direct air capture.
","This ETSA system uses sorbent-coated carbon fibers that exhibit Joule heating and rapid temperature swings for improved CO2 direct air capture. The sorbent-coated carbon fibers capture CO2 from ambient air at room temperature and desorb the CO2 simply by applying an electric potential to heat the fibers. The sorbent-coated fibers quickly respond to the electrical signal, enabling rapid CO2 regeneration. The ETSA module releases ~95% of adsorbed CO2 six times faster than externally driven thermal desorption.¬†The sorbent-coated carbon fibers use commercially available materials and a roll-to-roll coating system for simplicity and modularity. That, coupled with the rapid adsorption/desorption cycling by this ETSA, has the potential to improve the productivity of DAC systems relative to traditional temperature swing adsorption processes.","
	Higher heat transfer rates: Joule heating results in higher heat transfer rates than indirect heating methods (e.g., external heaters, steam) and is potentially comparable to direct steaming methods.
	Faster: This technology provides more than ten times faster temperature controls and six times faster CO2 desorption rate in vacuum-assisted ETSA than TSA operation under the same DAC conditions.
	Larger capacity: The dual-layered structure composed of a Joule heating core and a CO2-adsorbing coating layer results in larger amounts of CO2 chemisorption to occur compared to other materials that employ Joule heating.
	Greater adsorption: Sorbent-coated carbon fibers adsorb CO2 from air or flue gas via chemisorption, capturing more CO2 even in dilute CO2 environments.
	Cleaner: This ETSA releases CO2 in pure form.
	Smaller systems: High heating rates eliminate the need for auxiliary water heaters and treatment systems, potentially resulting in smaller carbon capture systems than traditional temperature swing adsorption processes.
	Efficient: Its efficient heat management during the electrothermal desorption has the potential to reduce cooling energy needs.

Large-scale ANN computations that require numerous repetitive calculations can be costly and may produce incomplete results. Existing technologies are unable to accurately predict solutions involving rapid state changes (e.g., shockwaves, contact discontinuities, thermodynamic phase changes, material disparities). The common input deficiencies limit the ANN from capturing such discontinuities. For example, in comparisons of assessments of a shock wave and a smooth wave in the same space-time domain, current low-resolution solutions would not offer differentiated output.¬†
","This novel method offers a unique input design that provides a low-cost solution to achieve highly accurate results. The ANN has an innovative input system that processes low-cost numerical solution patches arising from a sequence of solutions that converge toward the exact solution of the differential equations. When a considerable number of repetitive calculations are required, the savings of using this technology can be realized quickly. The input‚Äôs unique design is efficient as it utilizes local space-time patches covering the local domain of dependence, unlike the existing standard ANN. The complete input strategy enables the ANN to accurately predict large-scale solutions of differential equations with multiple discontinuities. A shock wave and smooth wave will have differentiated output with sharper resolution than present industry standards. Industrial design processes (e.g., engine chamber design, aircraft shape optimization, structure design) as well as scientific research benefit from the adaptability of this technology as a stand-alone solution or in combination with pre-existing commercial software.¬†","

Consumer interest in electric vehicles (EVs) is on the rise due to increasing environmental awareness, decreasing vehicle costs, and regulatory pressures and tax incentives. More EVs means more uncontrolled EV charging, which could exacerbate the evening surge in power demand, degrade power quality, and overload transformers in distribution networks. Smart charging (SC), where EV charging is optimally distributed over time to balance the benefits of the EV owner/grid operator, has emerged to combat these demand spikes. However, many SC solutions assume a decision-making agent controls the charging of multiple EVs, which is often not the case in a neighborhood setting.¬†

8297,Chemically Modified Reduced Graphene Oxides (rGOs) Improve Strength and Qualities of Polymer Composites,"Reinforcing thermoplastics using reduced graphene oxides is challenged by poor solubility and aggregation
Despite favorable performance for radiation attenuation, polyethylene and many other polyolefins generally possess lower tensile strength and impact toughness than high-performance polymer systems, such as poly(ether ether ketone). Reinforcing polyethylene and other composites can improve mechanical properties while adding beneficial qualities, such as electrical conductivity and oxidation protection that increases their suitability for a wide range of applications.¬†

Reduced graphene oxides are a promising class of composite reinforcement materials due to their scalability and tunable properties; however, commercial deployment of rGOs is challenged by their poor solubility and tendency to aggregate. Furthermore, the potential economic benefits of rGOs are limited because existing production strategies impose restrictive processing requirements or energy-intense purification methods.
","By chemically modifying reduced graphene oxides (rGO-dodecyl or rGO-dd) for high-density polyethylene (HDPE) reinforcement, commercially viable and scalable production is possible for a broad range of applications.¬†Typically, rGOs aggregate, which limits their ability to form homogeneous composites with polymers and renders them insoluble. This new approach uses a strong base and an alkyl halide to chemically bond with the undesirable functional groups left over from the exfoliation, oxidation, and reduction processes used to make rGOs. The rGO-dd product is easily recovered by adding methanol to the reaction mixture and then purifying via filtration. After purification, the alkyl chains prevent rGO-dd particles from aggregating, improving their dispersion in numerous solvents and their miscibility with many thermoplastics.¬†Two melt fabrication processes were developed. Melt compounding, in which rGO-dd material is blended with a polymer matrix, has demonstrated sheet resistances (RS) of 106 Œ©-m at 10% loading of rGO-dd. The melt compounding option is suitable for conventional thermoplastic processes, such as injection molding or extrusion.¬†The second processing technique involves solvent casting (drop casting or spray coating) a dispersion of rGO-dd onto a thermoplastic and then thermally fusing the particles to form a robust coating. With this approach (which is not possible without the ability to form stable dispersions in volatile solvents) sheet resistances have been demonstrated as low as RS‚âà10 Œ©-m, which far exceeds comparable anti-static coatings. These coatings are sufficiently conductive to not only provide static charge protection but also enable other active technologies, such as Joule heating, stress analysis, or dust mitigation.","
	Reinforcing: The homogeneity of the composites enhances mechanical properties, such as tensile loading.
	Anti-static: Melt lamination results in a robust anti-static coating that is more durable than comparable polymer-based coatings.

Additionally, coatings can be applied to the same substrate in varying thicknesses at different points and can even be used to build up three-dimensional structures on the substrate.
	Scalable: The easily scalable solution chemistry and purification/filtration make the process economically feasible, resulting in a commercially viable material for many applications.

Over 30 million people suffer from valvular heart disease, and close to 200,000 valve replacements are performed each year. Current heart valves are typically permanent mechanical or bioprosthetic devices and have critical limitations. In pediatric patients who grow at rapid rates, these permanent devices quickly become too small, which increases risk of adverse events and necessitates replacements. Although 3D-printed heart valves currently exist and bioresorbable materials have been in use for implants, the two have not been combined.
","Resorbable, patient-specific heart valves offer great flexibility for treating a wider range of conditions and patients than traditionally manufactured heart valves as well as potentially decreasing complications due to poor fit. Made of bioresorbable materials, the valves will eventually be absorbed by the body and replaced by new tissue that will perform the function that the device once served. This is especially important for pediatric patients.This versatile technique results in devices composed of optimal materials for specific conditions, diseases, and patients. The device can be made from a wide range of polymeric materials to match the mechanical behavior of specific tissues or metallic materials that can also be 3D printed and are bioresorbable. They can also include a combination of both types of materials.Devices can be personalized to fit the optimal valve geometry, have bulk and surface properties to match the surrounding tissues, and accommodate the delivery mechanism for the specific application (e.g., transcatheter, open heart). They can also be designed to consider patient anatomy, age, condition, or disease as well as speed and cost factors.Additional customization can include patterned surfaces that help the device better interface with surrounding tissues as well as provide friction to secure it and encourage cell growth. Device materials can be functionalized with proteins, other molecules, drugs, or even cells harvested from the patient to promote cell growth, tissue adhesion, proliferation, vascularization, and more.","
	Precise fit: 3D printing enables precise patient-specific designs that offer a better fit, treatment options for more patients, and treatment for a wider range of conditions.
	Reduced risk of complications: Custom-designing resorbable devices specific to patients can potentially decrease risk of complications due to poor fit, reduce the need for reinterventions, and result in overall better patient outcomes.

Unwanted bacteria growth can cause the formation of biofilms on medical device surfaces, in city infrastructures like water distribution systems, and on food processing and other industrial equipment. These biofilms can cause problems such as clogging and biocorrosion; serve as reservoirs for pathogens and antibiotic-resistant genes; and cause process failures, material waste, and safety issues.¬†
","Applying electrode patterns to a surface generates a strong electric field that will inactivate bacteria and inhibit biofilms quickly and efficiently. Differing the patterns by varying the width and spacing between interdigitated electrodes enhances the electric field and its ability to inactivate bacteria. Another design uses floating nanotips with high aspect ratios densely arranged between the positive and negative electrodes. The electric field will be largely enhanced at the ends of the nanotips, leading to bacteria inactivation and biofilm inhibition.This antimicrobial surface can be applied to flat surfaces, curved surfaces, and soft structures and has many potential applications.","

	Effective: Studies have demonstrated that both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including antibiotic-resistant bacteria, are inactivated by electric field treatment on the antimicrobial surface.
	Safe: Because it uses a physical process targeting cell membranes or capsid, electric field treatment is chemical-free and less likely to induce antimicrobial resistance.¬†
	Increased efficiency: Requires very short electrical pulses to achieve effective bacteria inactivation, potentially leading to higher antimicrobial efficiency.

9124,Paper-Based Multi-Well Depletion Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) Enables Point-of-Care (POC) Testing,"ELISA tests require centralized laboratories staffed with trained personnel
The most common serological testing methods utilize either lateral flow assays (LFAs) or ELISAs to detect antibodies induced by past infections. The low cost and convenience of LFAs, which wick samples into a porous substrate via capillary action and visually report target antibodies as colored bands, make it the preferred assay format for POC testing. However, the method‚Äôs convenience comes at the expense of quantitative results. The binary colorimetric output of LFAs cannot report the antibody titer‚Äîan important parameter that is closely correlated with the degree of immunoreactivity against a pathogen or a transplant.

ELISA testing is the gold standard for detecting target molecules in bioassays, including the serological assays that quantitatively measure specific antibody titers. However, determining antibody titers using ELISA is labor intensive and involves multiple steps that must be performed by trained staff in clinical laboratories. Because the sample must be serially diluted and distributed over an array of wells, the overall complexity of the process makes it challenging to adapt ELISA assays for POC use.
","This new paper-imprinted LFA automatically performs a multi-well ELISA assay for POC titer measurements. Eliminating the numerous, time-consuming pipetting steps typically required, this device serially dilutes the target analyte and distributes it to individually isolated wells to create a concentration gradient. The assay measures titer by gradually immuno-depleting the target analyte from a flowing sample. It also automatically and programmatically performs the delivery of reagents based on preset incubation times required to execute an optimal ELISA protocol. This automation is achieved with a lateral flow device equipped with an imprinted flow controller that is programmed with delaminating timer gates.¬†This technique has the potential to transform a variety of ELISA-based tests exclusively performed at clinical laboratories into single-use, disposable dipstick tests to be used at the point of care or home.","
	Simplifies ELISA testing: This technology eliminates the need for centralized laboratories staffed with trained personnel who perform multiple steps in a specific sequence to execute the assay workflow.
	Enables ELISA-based POC testing: A variety of ELISA-based tests currently performed exclusively in clinical laboratories are potentially transformed into single-use, disposable dipstick tests to be used at the point of care or at home.
	Flexible and proven: The assay can be adapted to multiple conditions. Assay measurements have been demonstrated in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody titers (IgM/IgG antibodies to nucleocapsid and spike protein) and troponin I (a cardiac biomarker).

8581,Streamlined Combination Analysis by FORECAST Accurately Predicts and Identifies Pending Malware Attacks,"Overcoming malicious software post-detection is a complex and inefficient process  
The detection of malware is only the start of months of chaos for the targeted system(s) and its analysts. Once a system is known to be under attack, analysts are tasked to work against the clock to fully understand the malware‚Äôs capabilities and identify solutions to prevent future damage. The current practice of having analysts perform complex context switching between static disassembler and memory forensics is arduous and inefficient. The analysts can quickly become overloaded in the repetition and data load, thereby increasing the risk of human error.¬†

The current standalone incidence response procedures are problematic. Without combining the common techniques of symbolic execution and memory forensics, path explosions and high false-negatives will limit accuracy, respectively. As malware becomes increasingly more sophisticated, the solutions to overcome cyberattacks must be swifter and more precise.
","Combining symbolic analysis and memory forensics through a feedback loop, FORECAST automates the path identification of malware and then triages its capabilities with path probability. This streamlined process is significantly faster than the tedious assessment currently required of analysts.¬†FORECAST utilizes early inputs from memory images to provide an impressive overall accuracy of 94% in path identification.¬† Its probabilistic model alerts analysts of the capability forecast (e.g., 31% code injection, 15% file extraction, 54% command & control URL) for the detected malware. The automated combination analysis removes the need for an analyst to focus on stitching up code or be consumed by the context switching. This frees up cognitive effort to focus on solutions of the probable paths rather than their identification, thereby increasing the analysts strategic time-advantage over the malicious software.","
	Faster: Automating the combined analysis through a feedback loop eliminates the tedious context-switching analysis required by analysts.¬†
	Accurate: FORECAST‚Äôs automated identification of probable paths is significantly more accurate (94% accuracy, overall) than the results of data-heavy processing by analysts.
	Strategic: Removing the need for analysts to focus on identification of probable paths allows more strategic time to be focused on finding solutions to circumvent the paths.

Its flexible design moves with facial profile changes, while the sensors detect and alert the wearer to any leaks. It also prompts the wearer to make adjustments to prevent pressure injuries when wearing the RPD for extended periods of time.The process begins with digital scanning of the individual‚Äôs face and creation of the 3D-printed custom-fit RPD frame. Advanced algorithms inform precise sensor positioning based on analysis of the wearer‚Äôs facial profile to ensure continuous monitoring of the fit. The sensors are close to the wearer‚Äôs face to capture the changes in pressure at the faceseal when facial expressions change; however, they do not contact the skin to avoid contamination. The sensors are embedded in a flexible base frame with a matching interlocking cover with specially designed screw sets that hold them securely in place.

This technology can potentially produce a valve that continuously grows with the patient and precludes the need for multiple heart valve replacements during the patient‚Äôs lifetime.The scaffold is created using a biodegradable polymer material, such as polycaprolactone (PCL), and a biodegradable non-toxic metal alloy. Synthetic polymers like PCL, known for tunability and low cost, have long been used for cardiovascular applications, such as heart valve repairs and replacements. A prototype of the fetal valve was manufactured by laser cutting a resolvable ZnAl metal tube. The leaflets were constructed with a sutureless spray-on or dip-coat technique using the safe bioresorbable synthetic polymer PCL.When combined with the latest in-utero surgical procedures, this cutting-edge polymeric valvular repair strategy may help restore healthy hemodynamics and mitigate many of the problems arising from congenital heart defects in children.",,,"Polymers/Membranes,Biotechnology,Medical Devices","Hieu Bui,Lakshmi Prasad Dasi,Sanchita Bhat,Aimee K.

The consortium-based transcriptional programming structure uses species of Bacteroides that have a significant, lasting presence in the human gut microbiome.The programming framework demonstrates sequential gain-of-function control in a consortium of five distinct Bacteroides species using complete sets of logical operations. It confirms control in both heterologous and endogenous genes by coupling the transcription program with clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) interference. In addition, this new technology can be deployed in consortia to display concurrent, asymmetric, and sequential decision making.Unlike Cello circuits, the current approach in gene circuit design, consortium transcriptional programming shortens circuit-building time, offers a compact circuit footprint that allows more complexity, uses fewer endogenous cellular resources, and reduces cell communication time in the Bacteroides community.While this innovation still requires demonstration in a host or equivalent model system, it provides an outstanding foundation for the next generation of living therapeutics and an advanced platform to greatly enhance the study of the Bacteroides genus.",,,"Biotechnology,Diagnostics,Pharmaceuticals,Research Tools,Biological",Corey J.

9002,Expandable Back Drive‚ÄìResistant Wedge Improves Payload Support and Security in Satellite and Other Limited-Access Applications,,"This expandable back drive‚Äìresistant wedge is a payload support system for limited-access environments, such as small satellite installations. By creating a more predictable load path, the technology eliminates potential damage to the payload due to sudden shock loading that can occur as a result of higher stresses from cantilevered loads. Expanding a wedge into the rails of the canister socket prior to inserting the payload generates the improved load path. By securing both ends of the payload, this approach creates a fixed-fixed beam load instead of a fixed-free cantilevered load.As shown in the first figure below, the expandable cartridge wedge has two straight, parallel arms (snubbers) with angled ends that meet at a central hub. The snubbers remain parallel, while a tapered key at the distal end is driven in remotely to expand the arms outward to contact the socket. Driving the tapered key remotely allows payload installation into a blind socket and still achieves a fixed-fixed load condition.The wedge and snubber mechanism expand to adjust to the rail dimensions and securely close the gap between the rail and the payload. To predictably transfer lateral load, the snubbers make and maintain rigid contact with the socket walls throughout the duration of the mission. The expanding wedge generates load only up to the desired maximum.Additionally, two offset, spring-activated pawls make the cartridge resistant to vibration by holding the wedge in place after establishing proper contact. A specialized tool releases the pawls to allow system unloading and payload removal.",,,"Defense and Security,Mechanical,Aerospace","Raymond J. Warner III,Michael Jeffries,Christopher A.

8831,Patterned Implantable Devices for Improved Reconstruction of Tubular Tissue Passageway Defects,,"This innovation advances splinting devices by applying functional patterns for passageways or tubular tissues (e.g., trachea, bronchi, esophagus, nerves, blood vessels) to potentially enable long-passageway reconstructions currently not possible. It also has the potential to address growth in pediatric patients who have undergone reconstruction. The stent-patterned device can be used to externally support long-passageway defects or as a framework for pre-vascularized tubular tissue flaps during reconstruction of long-passageway defects after resection.While the application of the stent-pattern that creates longitudinal bending flexibility decreases the radial rigidity of the device, the rigidity issue is addressed by either increasing the wall thickness or using an extrusion-based 3D-printing method while maintaining the same wall thickness. When this stent-patterned device is used as a framework for the pre-vascularized tubular tissue flap, it has a core post in the luminal area that is connected to the device with multiple thin bridges.

They are attached at each end to an annular plate, one of which is anchored and the other free moving. Three tendons are routed through holes in the fixed plate and attached to the free-moving plate to enable movement in three dimensions. Optionally, fewer tendons can be used to restrict movement to a specific plane. Multiple spring elements and tendons can be incorporated into a single guidewire to create variable sections of stiffness.This design offers alternate approaches that can include using a machined outer tube (either continuous or sectioned), elastic elements placed inside the guidewire with the tendons routed along an inner lumen, or elastic elements attached between the fixed plate and the free plate that enable radial expansion and contraction that can lock the guidewire in place.Another design uses electroactive polymers (EAPs) as actuators. Each EAP element is electrically isolated and connected to the fixed plate and free-moving plate‚Äî similar to the tendons in the previous design. The elastic elements can consist of a spring, electroactive polymers, shape memory alloys (SMAs), or combinations of those. For SMA-based elastic elements, the electrical pathways enable actuation by forcing the SMA to undergo phase transition upon heating, resulting in an elastic force to be exerted at the appropriate location along the length of the guidewire.Using this approach, multiple elements can be incorporated into a single guidewire to create discrete sections of variable stiffness.",,,"Agriculture & Food,Biotechnology,Medical Devices,Mechanical,Robotics","Jaydev P.

9014,Tactical Gloves for Accurately Tracking Munitions Use,,"To increase the accuracy and improve operator functionality, Georgia Tech researchers have developed tactical gloves with Tactical Passive RFID Transponder and Morphological Actuation. These gloves include an antenna that is woven into the palm of the glove, which is constructed of comfortable, flexible materials that can operate at a range of frequencies, allowing for the use of multiple gloves in one area at the same time. The gloves themselves are constructed of resistive fabric, allowing for the quantification of deformation and glove morphology with an inlaid force sensor. In doing so, the RFID can transmit to an external receiver where a software program can determine if a load is being handled, improving accuracy. To resolve operation ambiguities and improve safety, the gloves include a fingerprint scanner. ¬† These gloves can not only be utilized in a military setting but can also improve the general safety of civilian firearm users and improve inventory management.",,,Defense and Security,"Erick Niels Maxwell,Eres David,Samuel Finlayson,Dean Fullerton,John Kealy,Cameron Lewis,Jacqueline Ramirez-Medina,Jonathan Ridley,Kelden Robinson,Rudra Pratap Singh,Samrin Zaman,Michael Matthews,Steven Paul Eicholtz,Dante Gabriel Orlando,Daniel Andrew Terrell",,"Patent application has been filed

8143,High-Performance Analog Processor Offers Potential to Expand Capabilities of Radio Frequency (RF) Systems,,"Transversal Radio Frequency Filter Integrated Circuit (TRAFFIC) is the first generalized, modular, and broadband analog FIR processor integrated circuit and architecture. This versatile technology allows for analog multi-functional RF systems with the ability to support bidirectional communications on the same frequency. It enables front-end direct processing of RF signals for frequency filtering, linearization, matched filtering, and isolation. TRAFFIC‚Äôs characteristics are determined by a set of multiplying parameters rather than by physical components as in traditional analog filters. These programmable values can be changed to easily alter the processor‚Äôs characteristics and produce a better representation of the ideal signal despite variations in degradation factors.¬†",,,"Antennas,Signal Processing,Defense and Security,Circuits,Components","Nelson Lourenco,Douglas Denison,Bill Hunter,Christopher Coen,John Cressler,Moon-Kyu Cho,Ickhyun Song,Adilson Cardoso",,"The following patent application has published¬†

9052,Microfluidic Device Enables Prediction of T-Cell Ability to Home and Engraft to Disease Tissues,,"Tumor infiltration by CD8+ ¬†(cluster of differentiation 8) T cells has been used to improve clinical response with ACT and has resulted in reductions in disease burden and improved survival. Thus, CD8+ T-cell tumor homing and engraftment is considered critical for the success of ACT.This engineered microfluidic device models the microenvironment of the tumor vasculature ex vivo and incorporates the effects of hemodynamic flow to predict the in vivo homing and engraftment of CD8+ T cells. The method enhances adhesion in flow in vitro, which results in increased tumor homing in vivo by adoptively transferring CD8+ T cells and show improved tumor control in combination with a therapeutic blockade of immune checkpoints.This new approach has the potential to not only address the delivery limitations of ACT and enhance immunotherapeutic effects, but also yield new insights into subpopulations of CD8+ T cells. It could have wide implications in the field of cancer as well as viral infections.",,,"Biotechnology,Diagnostics,Medical Devices,Pharmaceuticals,Research Tools","Susan N.

8986,Quickly and Easily Generate Designer Photopatterned Hydrogel Matrices for Complex Microfluidic Tissue/Organ-on-a-Chip Devices,,"Unlike PEG-MAL hydrogels, norbornene functionalized PEG (PEG-NB) hydrogels are crosslinked using a photoinitiated reaction with thiol groups. This reaction, through localization to the irradiated area, supports better spatiotemporal control of crosslinking and patterning. It represents a viable alternative to PEG-MAL by enabling facile cell patterning and the study of cell responses to antigens as well as culturing primary B cells ex vivo.With this innovation, complex patterns (including biomolecular, cellular, and chemical gradients) can be generated in a synthetic hydrogel system using spatial patterning of the polymer network, proteins, multiple immune and non-immune cell types, and other non-cellular entities. This approach reduces timing and compatibility issues and offers designer flexibility compared to natural matrices.",,,"Nanomaterials,Biotechnology,Diagnostics,Medical Devices,Research Tools","Ankur Singh,Manuel Quinones Perez,Zhe Zhong,Christopher R.

8007,"Fast, Effective Thrombolytic Agent for Arterial Blood Clots",,"While studying the thrombolytic capabilities for N-acetylcysteine (NAC)‚Äîa medication used to thin mucus in conditions such as asthma and cystic fibrosis‚Äîresearchers determined that N,N'-diacetyl-L-cystine (DiNAC), the disulfide dimer of the amino acid cystine, has the potential to be a highly efficient thrombolytic agent. During in vitro testing to study the efficacy of known and proposed thrombolytic agents, DiNAC dissolved thrombi in as quickly as 90 seconds.Specifically, perfusion of DiNAC, reduced the diameter and surface area of VWF-platelet-rich thrombi by 50‚Äì95 percent. Researchers observed macroscopic fissures in the thrombus body, followed by the formation of tethered fragments and finally an eventual break with tolerable micro emboli passing downstream. These results indicate that DiNAC could possibly act as an effective thrombolytic agent against arterial blood clots, with the potential to mitigate life-threatening side effects of hemorrhage associated with current thrombolytic therapies.",,,"Biotechnology,Pharmaceuticals,Research Tools","David Ku,Dongjune Kim,Susan Shea",,The following patent application has published and additional international coverage is pending ,WO2022067248A1,,,,https://web.miniextensions.com/B9bhAseqAfEo5DpejEq7/recXfcUjPFljAg91G,"8007- Fast, Effective Thrombolytic Agent for Arterial Blood Clots",,,
